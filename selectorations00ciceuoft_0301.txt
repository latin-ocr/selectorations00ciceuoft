open.’' 4. Declarant hujus ambusti, (lc, “Those lifeless ruilings of
that scorehed tribune of the people show (this).'’ The tribune referred
to was T. Munatius Plancus Bursa, who, endeavoring to excite the people
against Milo, tore up the benches and furniture in the senate house, with
which he made a funeral pile for the body of Clodius, and near which,
while it was bui-ning, he continued to hal-angue the people, till he was
forced by the heat to retire; hence the epithet ambusti. This is the lan-
guage of keen sarcasm: intermortuae, properly, “between life and
death,’' “ dead and alive by turns.” 5. Qua» quidem si, (tre, “If this
indeed is to be called power:'' potentia means ability to do, potestas
authority to do ; the former expresses what we can do, the latter what

 

 

 

 

we may do. 6. Hanc vero qumstionem, “That this trial” (viz., of
Milo). The argument is, that as this trial of Milo (however just) was not
by the appointnient of the senate (but by a special coinmission of Pom-
pey), the death of Clodius was an event at which they were not much
grieved, and the conduct of Milo was not much blamed: nova quaes-
tio, “an extraordinary inquisition.’' 7. Cujus enim, die„ “For (see-

 

 

 

ing that) the power of appointing a judicial investigation concerning that
profane debauch of his was wrested from the senate, who ean believe,
&cf Iu order to carry on an intrigue with Sempronia, the wife of Julius
Caesar, Clodius, under the disguise of a female, gained admittanee to Cae-
sar’s house, while the mysteries of the Bona dea were celebrating, at
which it, was profanation for a male to be present. By the pontifex, this
was declax-ed saerilege; but, through the efforts of the Clodian faction, all
efforts to bring it to trial proved unavailing. 8. Cur ἐρίων, dcc. By
this question, Cicero adroitly shows, that this decree of the senate con-
demned, as an offence against the state, the several acts of violence eom-
rnitted by the clodian party, as much as it did the death of Clodius. He
specifies as examples—incendium eurico. See Note 4: oppugnatio-
nem aedium M. Lepidi, “the attaek on the house of M. Lepidus.” On the
death of Clodius, Lepidus wass declared inter-rex. The factions of Scipio
and Hypsaeus‚ in order to force an immediate election, which Lepidus
was unwilling to hold, while the resentment of the populace was fresh
against Milo, attacked his house, insulted his wife, and committed other
acts of violence, till they were driven off by the partisans of Milo.
9. Quia nulla vis, dte. In this answer to his own question, Cicero shows
that, as every violent act is against the state, the deci-ee of the senate
was general, and had no more reference to the acts of Milo than to the
acts of others referred to. 10. Nisa· vero, “Unless indeed’' (which,
however, cannot be supposed): non tamen rem publicam vulnera·

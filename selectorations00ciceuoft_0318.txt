subject of coyitat, and refers to Milo. Illi and ille refer to Clodius:

miis, &e., “Which he knew was set up and almost sold (given away) fo1
the highest price‚” alluding to the practice of setting up goods at auetion
and selling them to the highest bidder. 8. Martemqvae communem,

interclusum, “separated‚'’ “eut off from his party :'’ de ejus extremis
comitibus, “about his (Milo's) attendants in the 1·ear.” Milo, it would
appear, was at the head of his company; Clodius meeting him suffered
him to pass, when his men thrust themselves between Milo and his fol·
lowers and separated them. (This is the order of events presented here
by Cieero; the eommon account, however, makes Milo’s followers the
aggressors. See Introduction.) A confliet ensued, and the followers of
Milo, having heard that he was killed, inflamed with anger, and despair-
ing of his lise, determined to be revenged. The party of Clodius was
routed, and Clodius himself severely wounded ; he was afterwards killed
by order of Milo: hoesz‘c in iis poenis, &e., “did not escape that pun-
ishment: lit„ was entangled (stuek fast) in that punishment.'' The allu-
sion is to a wild beast entangled in a net, from which it cannot escape.—
Milo rewarded his slaves by giving them their liberty. His enemies
represented this as a device of his, to prevent them from being examined
by torture, and so testisying against him. lo. Manebat, scilicet, “He
was afraid, som-ooth? Scilicet indicates the irony of the sentence. ln

turer has nothing to do with this question. 12. Facti enim, &e.,
“For the investigation of a fact belongs to the rack-of its justice, to the
judges,⁹⁵ The equuleus was a wooden instrument resembling a horse
(hence its name), on which slaves among the Romans were tortured to
make them speak the nuth-a method as absurd as it was inhuman. As
then the only thing which the torture eould elicit was the fact, and that
was already oonfessed by Milo, Cicero argues Milo‘s reason sor manu-
mitting his slaves-could not be that alleged by his enemies. The true
reason is stated aLi defended in the next chapter.

Flusr ORATION AGAINST omnus.. 159

VI1.—1. Sic enim ;—cnz'm here introduces a reason for the softened
tone of the preceding sentence. —— quoe nulla, “ none of which.” B.
§ 98, Obs. 9. A. &S ῤ 205, Rern. 17. 2. Amicis ae necessariis, “Friends
and eonnections.‘'-Amz·cus (from amo) is a friend who sineerely loves; 7ιέ-
eessarz'us (from necesse), a connection or friend, to whom one is bound by
certain ties, but it does not involve the idea of affection. The senate was
now unusually full (tanta frequentia), and though in it there were many
friends and connections of Catiline, yet such was the evidence of his guilt,
and such the universal abhorrence of his conduct, that not one of them

 

dared to salute him; but, with a feeling of indignation and disgust‚ all rose
and left that part of the benches (subsellia) where he sat. Such a mark
of displeasure had never been witnessed before3 and seeing this, Cicero
asks. 3. Vocis exspectas contumeliam, dxc? “Do you wait for the
further reproach to be expressed by the words (of these), though you are
already overwhelmed by the severest condemnation of their silence?’'
4. Quid, quod = Quid dicam de eo, quod? “What shall I say about
this, that2” This is a very common expression in Cicero, and generally
introduces something more surprising than what went before. Its mean-
ing may be expressed briefly in English by nay, nay even, but now, more-
over. This, however, will change the sentence from an interrogative
into an affirmative form; thus, here: “nay, even at your arrival those
seats near you were left empty :'‘ — nudam atque inanem, “bare and
empty,” i. e. “ wholly deserted.'' 5. Leto pacto—ut, “ In such a man-
ner as‚‘’ viz. In the belief that I was planning their destruction. The
comparison is very cutting, because the Romans were little concerned
about the hatred and fear of their slaves. 6. Injurz'a, “Undeserved-
1y‚” “Without just cause :’' offensum, “ odious:” quorum mentes
sensusque vulneras, “whose understandings and feelings you insult and
wound.'’ Vulneras is strictly applicable here to sensus only, but is
applied, by Zeugma, to mentes also, B. §15st 1. 2d. A. <Kc S. §323 1. (2).
You insult their understanding, by presuming on their want of dis-
cernment, and you wound their feelings by presenting yourself, in all
your guilt and odiousness, among them. ’7. Et jamdiu te nillil
judicat, &c., “And now for a long time, judges, that you think of
nothing but her destruction :’' patria being here represented as
parens omnium, the crime of Catiline is properly expressed, and held up
to greater detestatffin, by the term parricidium. 8. Quae tecum sic
ayit, dxc„ “Who thus deals with thee, and in a certain manner, though
silent, thus speaks :’' nullum, ὣς. From this to the eud of the sec-
tion is the remonstrance put by the orator into the mouth of the country
(patria) as· the “common parent of 2112’ 9. Impunita fuit ac libera,

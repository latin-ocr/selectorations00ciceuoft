peace and friendship with Oicero's bitterest enemy3 and to the alliance
between these two Cicero fell a sacrifice, along with the noblest of the
, senators. ‚The aged orator happened to be staying at his villa near
Tusculum, when he was insormed of the proscription, containing the names
of seventeen senators, and among 1116111 111056 of himself and his brother
Quintus. He determinet] to take to flight; and from his villa of Astura,
on the sea-coast, he embarked on board a ship, but was detained by con-
trary winds: at length, having proceeded as sar as Caieta (Gaeta), he
lauded in order to take rest in his villa near Formiae. But no sooner had
he arrived there than he learned that the place was surrounded by
soldiers: he fied towards the coast, but was overtaken by the emissaries.
The servants who aceompanied him offered to defend him, hut Cicero
forbade it: he ordered the sedan-ahah- in which he was carried to be put
down, and calmly looked at the murderers who were rushing towards him.
They were led on by Popilius Laenas, whose lise had been once saved by
Cicero in a criminal accusation. Cicero strotehed forth 1115 neck as far as
he could from the lectica, and bade 1116111 accomplish their work, and take
what they were seeking. They cut off his head and both hands3 and
Popilius Laenas hastened to Rome to carry the welcome present to
Antony, and received his reward. Autcny ordered the head to be nailed
to the rostra between 1116 hands: this was 1115 answer to the Philippies!

Thus died Cicero, on the ’7111 of December, Β. c. 43, ten days a'fter the
establishment of the‘triumvirate of Antony, Octavianus, and Lepidus,
towards the end of the sixty-fourth year of his life.

His fertility as an author during the later years of his life is truly
astonishing; nearly all 1115 philosophical wn'tings were coinposed in the
years B. c. 45 and 44, and the latter of them especially was at once the
most sruitful and important. It was this uninterrupted occupation with
‘the lostiest and noblest questions of human lise, that gave him the strength
and calmness with which he calmly looked death in the face.

Cicero was of a tall, thin fignre3 his neck was particularly long; his
features regular and manly, and the expression of his countcnance dignified
and winning. His bodily constitution was naturally weak; but by a well-
regulatcd mode of life, he had so strengthened it, that he bore with ease
the exertions of a public orator, and of an unwoaried student, down to his
old age. In his domestic life he was ainiable towards every body, indulgent
towards his children, kind to his friends. and gener-ons towards 1115 slaves.
His domestic establishment was splendid, and 1115 house was the res-ort
of all the distinguished men of the age. During the morning, until ten
o’cloek, he received visitor-s: and during the day 116 worked in his library;

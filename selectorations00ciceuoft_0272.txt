vestroe, “The sight of your numerous assembly:” laic autem locus,
“also this plaee‚’' viz„ the Rostra, a pulpit or stage erected in the Forum
from which oratore addressed the people in their public assemblies. It.
was so called because it was adorned with the beaks (rostra) of ships
taken from the Antians Β. C. 337. Autem here is not adversative, but
connective only, and may be rendered and, also, moreover: ad aym-
dum amplissimus “most dignified for addreffiing the people;'' because
none but men of the first note, or such as had borne offices of dignity in
the state, were allowed to treat with the people from that place: ,
ad dicendum ornatissimus, “most honorable for speaking ;’' as it conferred
great honor on him who worthily occupied it.--Only magistrates could
there propose any subject for ‘the consideration of the people (ayere cum
populo) ,- but any person properly qualified otherwise (optimo cuique patuit)
might speak upon it. Hence ayemlum and dicendum here. Quirites,
see ΙΙ. Or. in Cat. L. 1: Ιιοσ aditu laudi-3, “from this arenue to honor.”

cause was argued in his 26th year; his first public one, in the year
following3 and this oration, which was his first, appearance before the
people in the Rostra, was delivered in his 4lst year. Before this he had
held the office of quaestor, and aedile; and but a little before, by the
suffrages of the people, had been elected praetor. This he here calls
(fructus) the fruit of his labors. 3. Per aetatem, “On account of my .
youth.'’ High offices necessary to qualify one to treat with the people
from the Rostra could not be held in Rome till a certain age.
4. Hujus auctoritatem loci atlinyere, “To aspire to the honor of this
place :'’ amicorum temporibus, “to the affairs of my friends.’'
5. Ita neque, &a A negative and an affirmative clause, closely connected
by neque (nec) in the first, and et in the second, οι· vice versa, may be
rendered by connecting “on the one hand,” with the first, and “on the
othei-‚⁷⁷ with the second, ns in this sentence—“On the one hand, this place
has never (not ever) been without such as‚’' &e.; et, “and on the other.”

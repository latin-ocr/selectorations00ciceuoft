this refers to the method adopted by the kinsman of Clodius, to excite
the indignation of the people against Milo by exposing in public his
bloody corpse. See Introduction: spoliatum imayinibus, “ deprived
of its images.'' Persons of distinction among the Romans had their halls
adorned with wax images of their ancestors, which at funerals were car-
ried in procession before the corpse: exsequiis, “funeral obsequies.”
This term is general, and includes the following pompa, laudatioow, &et
infelicissimis liquis, see above Ch. V.‚ Note 4: laudare uon pos-

there is a defect in the text. The supplement in italics is proposed by

that the death of Clodius was injurious to the intel-ests of Milo.
4. A'on dicam admitteret, “I will not say should commit (this deed) but

supposed reply os a Clodian to the two preceding questions. “ Clodius

duces an objection to the preceding reasoniug. Admit, says the objector,
it was for Milo's interest that Clodius should live, yet such was his hatred
of Clodius, and so strong his passions‚ that he lost sight- of his interest,

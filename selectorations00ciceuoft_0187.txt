SEOOND ORATION AGAINST CATILINE.

INTRODUCTION.

Trm second Catilinarian speech was delivered on the 9th of Novem-
ber (the day after he delivered the first), before the assembled people in
the Forum. Catiline had left the city the night before, with 304> of his
followers, and his partisans at Rome endeavored to diffuse the opinion
that Cicero had treated Catiline too severely, and that the latter liasl
gone into voluntary exile to Massilia, in order not to distin-b the public
peace. Cicero refutes this belief, which was intended to· ronse the peo-
ple’s sympathy; he once more describes the grcatness of the criminal
plot, and expresses his firm conviction that Catiline was not going to
Massilia, but to the camp of Manlius. Hc lastly calls upon the conspira-
tors who had remained in the city, to quit Rome as specdily as their
leader, if they were unable to rctrace their evil steps. Several repeti-
tions, and more especially the division of the friends of Catiline into six
classes, render it highly probable that Cicero delivered this speech, like
the first, extempore.

NOTES.

 

1.-1. Tandem aliquando ; “At last then.'' Quirites, “Romans''
The Quirites originally were the inhabitants of Cures, a city of the
Sabines, who were afterwards called prisci Quirite& to distinguish thern
from the Romans. After the Sabincs and Romans had united themselves
into one community under Romulus, the name of Quirites was taken in
addition to that of Romani—the Romans calling themselves in a civil
capacity Quirites, while in a political and military capacity they retained
the name of Romani. Hence we find these nan cs were immediately
after combined, as Populus Romanus Quiritium, ‘ the Roman nation of
Quirites.'' See And. Lex. This accords with the account of Livy Ι. 13.
Ita qeminata urbe, ut Sabinis tamen aliquid daretur, Quirites α Caribus
appellati. Scil. the whole nation united. 2. V erbis prosecuti sumus,
“ We hav-e pursued with reproaches.’' 3. Abiit, dic. Lct the pupil

NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ORATION FOR T. ANNIO MILO. 275

Milo ordered his men to attack the house ; several of Clodius’s men were
slain, and Clodius himself dragged out and dispatched. His body was left
in the Appian road, but was soon after taken up by Tedius, a senator, who
happened to come by, and brought it to Rome, where it was exposed, all
covered with blood and wounds, to the view of the populace, who flocked
about itin crowds, to lanient the miserable fate os their leader. The next day
Sextus Clodius, a kinsman os the deceased, and oue of his chief incendia-
ries, together with the three tribunes hostile to Milo, employed all the arts
of party and factiou to inflame the mob, which they did to such a height
of sury, that sna-tching up the body, they ran with it into the senate-
house; and, tearing up the benches, tablcs, and every thing combustible,
dressed up a funeral pile upon the spot, and, together with the body,
burned up the house itself, with a basilica, or public hall adjoining. Sev-
eral other outrages were committed, so that the senate were obliged to
pass a demea—⁴⁴ that the inter-roz, assisted by the tribunes and Pompey‚
should take care that the republiC received no detriment, and that Pom-
pey in particular should raise a body of troops for the common security.''
These he presently drew together from all parts of Italy. Aniidst this
confusion, the rumor of a dictator being industriously spread, and alarming
the senate, they resolved prcsently to create Pompey the single consul,
whose elect-ion was accordingly declared by the inter-rex, after an inter-
regnum of near two months. Pompey applied himself immediately to
quiet the public disorders, and published several new laws prepared by
him for that purpose·, one of them was to appoint a special commission to
inquire into the death of Clodius, dic„ and to appoint an extraordinary
judge of consular rank to preside in it. He attended Milo⁷s trial himself,
with a strong guard to preserve peace. The accusers were young Appius,
the nephew of Clodius, M. Antonius, and P. Valerius. Cicero was the
only advocate on Msso’s side, but as soon as he rose to speak, he was met
with so rude a clamor by the friends of Clodius, and so discomposed by
the sight of an armed soldiery which surrounded the seat of judgment,
that he was disconcerted and confused, and fell far short of his usual ex-
cellence and power. Milo was condemned, and. a few days afterwards,
went into exile at Max-semes. Cicero wrote out the oration afterwards as
it was intended to be delivered, and as we now have it, and sent a copy
of it to Milo in his exile.

Much of the excellence of the character of Milo, as here described,
must- be attributed to the embellishments of oratory, or the partialities
of sriendship. Though free from gross vices, with which the character
of Clodius was stained, he was not remarkable as a patriot, but unsri-upu-
lous and daring‚ sought for office by violence and intrigue, with a view

111.-—1. Eam orationem—eam partem orationis—quw propria est,
&e.‚ “Which properly belongs to the inquiry before you,'' scil„ which
waylaid the othere videantur ea, “it seems that these.⁷' See 111. Or.
in Cat. Ch. VIII. 2. 2. quant, dte. -ε dicum non, “They (the adver·
saries of Milo) say, that a man ought not, &cf Of this proposition Cice-
ro affirms the reverse, and in support of his affirmation brings forward
examples from Roman history. The first is that of M. Horatius. This
well—known story is related by Livy, Lib. I. 26. 3. Aut ozeyari so-
lere, &e.‚ “That usually it is either denied that the act was done at all,
or is maintained to have been done justly and lawfully.” It is the latter
of these Cicero proposes to maintain in defence of Milo. 40 Nisi
vero existimatis. This refers to his position already stated, as if he said:
This you must admit, “ unless indeed you think, dte. :'' seditiose in-
tmroyaretur, “it was asked in a factious manner.’' With a view to ex-
cite the people to revenge the death of T. Gracchus, Carbo, in a public
assembly of the people, put the question to Africanus, who had married
Sempronia, the sister of Gracchus, what he thought of his death, expect-
ing to receive a reply favorable to his wishes. Instead of this, however,
he replied, jare caesum videri. On 'hearing this, the peoplc loudly ex-
pressed their displeasure. But he cried out, “cease your noise; dare you
think to frighten me who am aceustomed to hear unterrified the shouts
of eontending armiesP' Respeeting the death of Gracchus, see Ι. Or. in
Cat. Ch. II. Note 17. Again you must admit this. 5. Neque em'm
posset, &e.‚ “For (if not) neither could either the distinguished {Servilius
Ahala, &e.‚ be held not to be guilty.” For Ahala, see Ι. Or. in Cat. Ch. II.
19. Opimius slew C. Gracchus, still attempting to revive the Licinian
law. To say nothing of the butcheries of Marius, even the senate itself
must be held guilty, on the p1·inei1)le maintained by the opponente of
Milo. 110 refers to the accomplices of Catiline who were put to death by
the order of the senate. 6. Fictis sabuli-5, “In fubulous story.” He
refers to the Orestes of EuripideS, and the Choephori of AEschylus. Ores-
tes, the son of Agamemnon, to rcvenge his father-’s death, slew his mother
Clytemnestra, by whom his father had been murdercd on his return from
Troy. For this deed he was acquittcd by the judgcs of the Areopagus
under the direction of Minerva. 7. Variatis hominum sententiis,
“The opinions of men (i. e.‚ the judgcs) being divided.’' This being¹ the
case, it is said Minerva joined herself to those in favor of acquitting,
making the number on each side equal. This amountcd t‹› an ιιι-1111111511.
8. Duodecim tabatha, “The laws of the twelve tablos.'' These
were the standard laws of the Romans, and they provided that, in certain
circumstances, a man might slay another with impunity.

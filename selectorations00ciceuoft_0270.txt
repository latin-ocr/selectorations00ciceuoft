exerted his influe] :ce upon them from the East: in short, the tribune C

Manilius brought forward a bill proposing that the war against Mithri

dates should be committed to Pompey3 that he should conduct it with
all the means 118 still had at his command; and that, accordingly, ho
should be lest in possession of his unlimited powers3 and, moreover, that
the interior of Asia also should be assigned to him as his province. The
moderate and truly republican patriots thought that this was going too
far, and that- it was dangerous to intrust so much power to one man. Q.
Catulus, and the orator Hortensius, accordingly opposed the bill of Mani-
lius; while others, and especially Julius Caesar, either in order to establish
a precedent, or to create a reaction against Pompey, by committing so
much power to him, spoke in favor of Manilius and Pompey. Cicero
himself defended the Manilian bill with all the influenee of his brilliant.
eloqnence, and induced the people unanimously to intrust to Pompey the
supreme command in the war against Mithridates.

The speech may be divided into two unequal parts, the first of which
extends to chap. 17, and is subdivided into three sections, which Cicero
himself describes towards the end of chap. 2. He speaks 1. De qenere
belli, of the nature of the war, for the purpose of showing that it is
necessary to continue it, and bring it to a close (chap. 1-8); 2. De maffni-
tudine belli, of its 1115111855, 10 show that it is dangerous, and requires
energetic measures (chap. 8-10); 3. De imperatore deliyendo (chap. 10-17),
of the appointment of a suitable commander, in order to show that Cn.
Pompey is above all others, the man to conduct such an important war,
because he possessos all the qualifications which a true general must have
—namely, experience, valor, military fame, and good-luck. In the second
part of the speech, which to some extent is a recapitulation of what has
already been said„ Cicero, in opposition to Catulus and Hortensius, en-
deavors to set forth the 11011851)Γ and disinterestedness of Pompey as con-
trasted in some measure with the conduct of Lucullus, and to refute the
idea of its being unusual and dangerous to accumulate so much power in
the hands of one man, by showing that similar things had occurred in the
case of other generals, and that an extraordinary measure was justified
by the extraordinary nature of the war.

The following chronological arrangement of the 8181115 of the war
against Mithridates may be useful to the student :—

Β. 0. 'Me—The third Mithridatio war. Lucullus is appointed commander
of the land forces, and L. Aurelius Cotta of the fleet. Mithri-
dates besieges Cyzicus and is surrounded by the army of
Lucullus.

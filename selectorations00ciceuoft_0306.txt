the election had been delayed full six months„ 5. L. Paullum colle-
qam cffugyere, “To avoid (having) L. Paullus as his colleague.'’ L. AEmi-
lius Paullus was praetor, B. c. 52. Clodius knew that a man of such
character and enei-gy would be an insui-mountable obstacle to the accom-
plishment of his designs. 6. Reliquit, &c., “He abandoned‚” “he
threw up his own year.'' It was considered an honor for a person to be
elected to a high office iu his own year, i. e., as soon as he attained the
legal age. That age for the praetorship was 40. Clodius at first proposed
himself as a candidate for this office suo anno. But secing that owing to
the latcneffi of the elections, he could hold it only for a few months, and
that he would be so cramped and settered by his colleague, he withdrew
his name, and reserved himself for the next, year. 7. Summo con-
sanam, “With the greatest unanimity.” 8. Contulit se ad ejus compe-
titores, “He betook himself to (i. e., he joined) his (namely, Milo's) com-
1·etit‹›rs‚” if possible to defeat him:
so much ardor:’'

 

 

 

 

ita, “in such a way,'' “with
totam ut petitionem ...... ρτιόενηανεί, “that he
alone managed the whole eanvass.'' 9. Collinam novam (tribum), &e.,
‘⁴ Ile formed a new Colline tribe, by a selectim), &ff The Collina was one
of the four city tribes. But though the largest, from having the libertini
united with it, it embraced the very lowest of the populace, and was of
com-se the least respectable. 10. Ille, Clodius: hic, Milo.. l
ll. Homo, “The man‚'’ meaning Clodius, using the word homo as a term
of reproach, and in contrast with virum, applied to Milo: occiden-
dum Milonem, “that Milo must be killed.'’ Cicero gives prominence to
this threatenffig, and repeats it several times. It appears also that Milo
threatened the death of Clodius, but it did not suit the purpose of Cicero
to mention this here. 12. Servos agyrestes et barbaros, “His rude
and barbarous slave-‘ss' Clodius had posseffiions in Etruria near the
Apennffles where he maintained bordes of slaves5 whom he employed in
carrying 011 his violent sehemes. 13. Siynfficavit‚· ‘⁴ He hinted
(privately to his f1·iends):’' dixit, ‘⁶ He openly said it:” aut
sunzmum, “or at the most.'’ As evidence of this, Cicero mentions that
Favonius immediately reported this statement to Μ. Cam, one of the
judges, and, by thus referring to his knowledge of the fact, adroitly
makes Cato a witness in the case, to a. material point, as well as a judge.

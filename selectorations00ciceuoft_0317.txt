ORATJON Fon Τ. ANNIUS MILO. 297

XX.—l. Videamus nunc, eve„ “ Let us now see, that which is a lead
ing point, to which of the two was the place where they met more fit for
an ambush.'' This he makes use of us another argument in favor of Milo:
and against Clodius. 2. Ante fundum Clodii, “It was before (i. e.‚
in front of) the estate of Clodius? facile mille, “at least a thou-
sand:'’
nent being elevated and lofty,'' i. e.‚ a high rising ground:
loci spe, “ with the hope of success from his very position.'' -— 3. Qum
semper valet plurimum, “And that always has great weight.’⁷
4. Quid horum non impeditissimum? “Which of these things was not a
very great hindraneeP’ From the place where they met, he passes to the

circumstances of euch, and from these draws still another argument in
support of his main position: quid minus promptum ad puynam!
“that less prepared for an engagement (than Milo was)2” 5. Videte
‘nunc illum, “Behold now that 1nan'' (Clodius). (3. Tarde ; qui con-
venit? “Slowly; with what propriety2” 7. Devertit in villam, &Q
“He turns aside to Pompey’s villa; was it to see Pompey? he knew he
was at Alsium''—a town of Etruria on the sea-coast near Caere, ‘where
probably Pompey had a country-seatss With Alsiensi supply villa. By
these interrogatories he brings forward and refutes the various false pre-

ne consfflered the true reason, viz„ mora et terqiversatio, &e

 

 

 

 

=XXL—l. Expediti, “Unencumbered,” “ready for aetion‚’' eontrasted
with impedimentis. 2. Comites Graeculi, “His attendants were paltry
Greeks.'' The diminutive is used to express contempt. He refers to the Greek
musicians painters, mountebanks, dre„ who usually aeeompanied him for
his amusement. These were common in the families of the rich at Rome:
castra Etrusca, referring possibly to those predatory bands with
which he 'was aeeustomed to harass Etruria, ᾧ 26 ; but more probably to
his secretly favor-ing the designs of Catiline. Asconius tells us, he aetu-
ally set out for the camp of Catiline at Faesulae, but before reaching it,
changed his mind and returned: —— naqa-rum, such as these Graecnlv'.
3. Pueros symphoniacos uxoris, “His wife’s music boys.’' Roman ladies
also maintained great numbers of such, usually Greeks, and were attend-
ed by crowds of waiting maids abroad, as well as at home. 11. Nisi
ut virum, dre„ “Unless you might say that each man was ehosen by his
comrade.‘’ When Roman soldier-s were sent on some danger-ons expedi-
tion, they were allowed to choose each man his comrade. To this there

Β. ὁ 34, Obs. 1.—A.&S. t} 137. 1 (c). The meaning is, “Your father was
never heard of till he married the daughter of Deiotarus and thus all the
consequence you enjoy as a family, is derived from your relation to him
whom you seek to destroy.” As in this sentence, the subject of a verb, in a
dependent clause, is sometimes rendered more prominent by placing it
first in the accusative as the object of the leading verb. See more exam-
ples. B. t} 116, Note 2. 3. Ilo771inum more, “ Like men,'' i. e, with

“There is slavery in being a master, and dominiou in being a slave.'' Thus
he argues that such a course as that of Castor is not only ungrateful and
impious, but if sanctioned by the authority of Caesar, would destroy the
bonds of social intercourse and revolutionize society. ⁷. In judicium

rejected the testimony of his slave, though voluntat-ily offered, and sent
him back to his master. Castor seduced the slave from his mastenhis
own grandfather—took him home to his house, and bribed him to bear

testimony against him; and that, too, more than once, as he now shows.
For after this slave returned to the ambassadors of Deiotarus, he acknow-

ledged, in the hearing of Sulpicius and Torquatus that he had been eor-
rupted by Castor, and impelled by his promises to act a deceitful part (in
frandem); yet now he was acting the same part again, and this shows
that he was bribed again. This coutrast places the case against the ac·
cuser in a strong light.

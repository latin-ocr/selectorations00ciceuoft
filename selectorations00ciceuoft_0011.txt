PREFAGE.

Tms work has been prepared to form one of the series of School Classies
in connection with the editor’s Latin Grammar. It embraces ten of the
best and most admired productione of the Roman Orator, connected with
some of the leading events and most distinguished characters in Roman
history. The text of eight of these is that of Orelli, now regarded as the
best, and is taken with only a very few alterations, mentioned in the
notes, from his revised edition. The text of the Oratiou for Marcellus is
that of Klotz, and of the oration for Milo, that of Madvig; for both of
which the editor is indebted to the late edition os Prof. Johnson. In all,
the modern has been substituted for the autiquated orthography of the
German editors. The brackets, used to indicate doubtful readings, have
been omitted as useless in a school book. The greatest care has been
taken to secure aeeuracy in the text, and to render the punctuation more
full and as accurate as possible. The seetiou numbers are retained,
because it is by means of these that references are made, in the excellent
Lexieon of E. A. Andrews, lately published.

The objects aimed at in the Notes appended, are: First, To keep
before the mind of the pupil the train of thought or of argument
pul-sued; for if that is lost sight of, all interest in the subject eeases, and
the whole becomes unintelligible or obscure. Secondly, To explain the
more difficult construetione and idioms, point out the peculiarities and
beauties of thought or expression as they occur, and generally to lead
the student. to understand the text, and appreciate its beauties: and
Thio-dep, To illustrate the subject by such historieal, biographical, and
archaeological notices, as were necessary t'o explain the text, and to‘thmw
light on the numerous allusions to persons and events, doubtless well
known to those before whom the orations were delivered, and which
must still be known, in order to a proper nuderstanding of the subject.

In carrying out these objeets, the design of the editor has been,
neither to sup'ensede the labor of the student, and eo depr-ive him of the

Crassus, received a number of auonymous letters, cautioning him against
Catiline and his bloody designs‚ and advisiug him specdily to take to ssight.
But, in the morning, Cicero produced these letters in the senate, distributed
them among the senators to whom they were addressed, and loudly called
upon Catiline to give an account of his proceedings. Catiline, after having
given an impudent and insolent answer, withdrew, uttering threats against
the senate. The result of all this, however, was, that at the elcctions on
the following day, D. J unius Silanus was elected first consul, and L. Lici-
nius Muraena received a few more votes than Catiliue, who was thus again
defeated.

Catilina now felt himself driven to extremities. and resolved to use vio-
lence3 he saw that the senate had taken serious precautions; that the
consuls, asin times of great danger, had received unlimited power; that
troops were sent to the districts threatened by the conspiraters; and that
Rome itself was, as it were, in a state of siege. Accordingly, in the night
between the eth and 'Yth ot'November‚ Catiline had a meeting of his friends
in the house of Laeca, where it was determined that Cicero and a number
of senators should bc murdered, that fire should be set to several parts of
Rome at the same time, and that Catiline should proceed to the camp
of Manlius. In the very hour in which this was planned, Cicero was in-
formed of it by Fulvia. He forthwith summoned a meeting of the senate
in thc temple of Jupiter Stator for the next day. Catiline had the auda-
city to make his appearance there, but the senators showed him thei»
abhorrence and contempt by moving from the places near the spot wliere
he sat. But as this had no influence upon him, Cicero, seized with amaze-
ment and indignation, rose and delivered this, his first oration against Cati-
line, which is one of the most splendid that have come down to us, more
especially because it bears the impress of an cxtempore speech, and thus
furnishes us the most perfect evidence of Cicero's brilliant and successful
eloquence.

“ In point of effect, this oration must have been perfectly elcetric. The
disclosure, to the crimina] himself, of his most secret purposes ·‚ their flagi-
tious nature, threatening the life of every one present3 the whole course
of his villanies blazoned forth with the fire of incensed cloquence3 and the
adjuration to him, by fleeing from Rome, to free his country from such a
pest, were all wonderfully calculated to excite astonishment, admiration,
and horror.

“ The great· object of the whole oration was to drivc Catiline into ban-
ishment. ; and it appears somewhat singular, that so danger-ons a personage,
and one who might have been so easily convicted, should thus have. been
forced, or even allowed, to withdraw to his army, instead of being sccurcd

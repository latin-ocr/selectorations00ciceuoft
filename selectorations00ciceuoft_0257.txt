led asti-ay, there is some excuse for him at a distance, and a foreigner.
This is Cicero‘s first excuse sor Deiotarus.
publicam defendendam datam, ‘* That the defcncc of the republic was
committed to 'the consuls, ἀῶ This was B. c. 48, in the consulship of
Marcellus and Lentulus: nobis imperatoribus, Cicero had obtained
the title of imperator (Or. for LigariuS, 111. Note 5) in the Cilician war,
and as proconsul, he, with other classes herc mentioned, had received from
the senate the command usually given in times of danger, ‘⁸ Ut videret ne
qnid res publica detrimenti caperet.⁷’ 4. (Sic em'm nuntiabatur.)
(¹⁴ For so he was told.’') This, however, was not strictly true, for Cicero,
SulpiciuS, and others remained. Italiam, ‘⁶ Italy,” i. e., “the people of
Italy :'’ esse effusam, “were dispersedf' 5. Talibus remittis, “For
such (incon-eet) reports ;” nec ulli veri, scil, nuntii subsequebantur, “ nor

and army to a successor, previous to his suing for a second consulship.
Caesar offered to disband his army, if Pompey did the same. He wanted

Yet, after all this, Deiotarus did not take part against Caesar, but remained
ncutral, tiu ambassadors and letters came to him from Pompey. This is
the second excuse offered for Deiotarus. 7. Quam dii—conyessissent.
See above Ch. 1„ Note lt tam tu ipse, &e., “but (on whom) even
you yourself bestowed very many and distinguished honors.⁷’ Caesar gave
to Pompey his daughter dulia to wife, and while she lived, the two leaders
were united, promoted each other's schemes, and votcd to each other the
highest offices and honors. ——- 8. Quanti honores populi Romani, “⁶ How
great honors from the Roman people :” populi, senatus, tui, here are

honors proceeded. B. ῥ 106, Obs. 1.—A. a S. ξ) 211, Rem. 2. 9. Superi.-

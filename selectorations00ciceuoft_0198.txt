THIRD ORATION AGAJN ST CATILJNE.

INTRODUCTION.

Tm: third speech was delivered before the assembled people, towards
the evening of the 3d of December, 24 days after the preceding. Catiline
was then in the camp of Manlius, surrounded by all the signs of the eon-
sular dignity; and it was now quite evident that the insurrection would
soon break out openly. The Senators had put on mourning ; Catiline and
Manlius had been declared public enemies3 the consul Antonius and Quin-
tus Metellus Celer advanced with an armed force to the north of Etruria,
when, uuexpectedly, Cicero made a new discovery. P. Cornelius Lentulus
Sura, and C. Cornelius Cethegus the leaders of the conspirators at Rome,
had fixed upon the 17th of December, the festival of the Saturnalia, for
murdering Cicero and other senators, and sor setting Rome on fire. Len-
tulus had endeavored to draw some Auobrogian ambassadors, who hap-
pened to be staying at Rome, into the conspiracy3 and they seemed at
first quite willing to enter into the scheme, but communicated the secret
to their patron, Q Fabius Sanga, who immediately revealed the whole to
Cicero. Sanga was now obliged to persuade the ambassadors to induce
the conspirators to give them letters to their associates in Etruria. When
they were departing with their letters to Catiline and Manlius, Cicero
ordered them to be arrested as they were crossing on the Mulvian bridge,
and to be brought to Rome, with their documents.——He then summoned
the heads of the conspiracy, Lentulus, Cethegus, Gabinius, and Statilius,
before they knew of the arrestbf the Allobrogian ambassadors, or sus-
pected that their plans were discovered, and obliged them to make a full
confession of their intended crime. Thereupon they were given into cus-
tody to separate individuals, who became responsible for them3 and the
senate deereed a public thanksgiving to the gods in honor of Cicero.
then the meeting of the senate broke up, Cicero immediately announced
the new discovery to the people‚ who were anxiously waiting to know the
issue; they loudly expreaeed their obligation and gratitude to their watch-
ful consul, and accompanied him home, as it were in a triumpha] proees-
Slon.

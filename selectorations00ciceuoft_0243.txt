ORATION Fon Q. LIGAmus. 223

any part against Caesar in Italy, but through his friends applied sor
pardon. At length the letter here referred to came, restoring him to his
former eondition; or, as he here expresses it: ut essem idem qui
fuissem, “that Ι should be what 1 had been‚” viz„ before the commence-
ment, of the civil war. Just, before that, Β. e. 51, Cicero, as proconsul,
had carried on⁴a successful war in Cilicia against the Parthians, his
soldicrs had saluted him as imperator, and the senate had granted him
the honor of a triumph, and the laurelled fasces. As, however, the dis-
turbanees of the time did not allow him to celebrate the triumph, Cicero
retained these fasces laureati, which belonged to an imperator, and

 

Caesar allowed him to do so. 6. Esse alm-mn passus est, “Sufl'ered
me to be a second imperator,'’ in name at least. 7. A quo, “From
whom,’' i. e., “by whose permission.’' 8. Ut, qui, i. e., Ut eqo qui,
&e., “That I, who hesitate not to speak of my own conduct (as trutb
requires), have no fear to speak of the conduct of Ligarius (which is so
much less offensive).’' 9. Cujus ...... industriae 9lorioeque, “Whose
application and love of fame? 10. Ad meum aliquem fructum
redundare, “May result in some advantage to niyself.⁷’ ll. Quis
putat esse crimen fuisse in Africa? “Who thinks it a crime, that he was
in Afi·iea2’' Nempe is, qui et ipse, &e., “That very man, forsooth
(Tubero), who even himself wished to be in that same Afriea‚’⁷ &a
12. Qui sensus erat armorum tuorum? “What was then the meaning of
thy armsT’ The impression made by this addi-ess and these questions
upon the audie—nee, and especially upon Tubero and Caesar, is said to
have been overwhelming, and is often alluded to by the ancients:
iisdem in armis fui, “I, too, was in arms on the same side? Cicero,

however, was not present at the battle of Pharsalia, but was left behind
at Dyrrhachium.

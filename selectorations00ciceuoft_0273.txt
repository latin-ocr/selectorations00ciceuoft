ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW. 253

of the comitia, οι· assembly for electing magistrates, took place nu the
notice of the augurs that the auspices were unfavorable, or on the inter-
, cession of a tribune, and by this the elec-tion was prevented. In this case
the comitia had been adjourned twice by the intercession of Cornelius.
A very corrupt nse was sometimes made of this power of adjourmnent:
proetor primus, “first praetor.” The first praetor was the one who
received the greatest number of votes, and whose name of course was
always mentioned first» In Cicero's time there were eight praetors3
Cicero was elected unanimously (cunctis centuriis) in the comitia centu-
riata. 8. Quid aliis praescriberetis, “What course you prescribe to
others‚” namely, who would attain to the same distinction: —-—- ad
ayendam facultatis tantum, “so much fitness for addressing you:”
apud eos, “before those! 9· Et si quid i‘n dicendo, &e., “And if I
can effect any thing by my oratory :'' qui eo: quoque rei, &e., “who
have thought that some recompense should be awarded by their decision
for this thing,’' scil, for skill in speaking. lo. Quod in liae insolita,
&e., lit.⁷ “Because in this kind of speaking from this place unusual to
me:'’ oratio, “eloquence.''

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IL—-l, Vestris vectigalibus, “To your public revenues.'' These con-
risted artly of the tributes in kind (decumae, “tithes ³⁷) from land, partly
›t' renfs paid for the use of pastui-age (scriptura), and partly of import
«nd export duties (portoria). They were fal-med to the equites, who
nere answerable to the state for the sums required: ·——— M‘itlzridate et
'fimana—the former, king of Pontus; the latter king of Armenia and
son-in-law of Mithridates. 2. Alter relictus, “The one (Mithridates)
being lest,'' i. e., allowed after his defeat by Lucullus to escape:
alter lacessitus, “the other being provoked.'' Lucullus having lest
Mithridates, and transferred the war into Armenia.. 3. Quorum
nwynoe res, &e., “Whose great fortunes employed in fax-ming your public
revcnues are at stake.’' In order to raise money, the Romans often sold
the rcvenues of a province or district to such as were able to advance
the money, generally to persons of the equestrian order, and authorized
them to collect the revenues as they became duc, to reimburse them-
selves and pay them for their trouble and outlay. This was usually a
profitable investment. But if in consequence of war, or other causes,
the revenues failed, the revenue fal-mers (publicani.) would be the losers:
qui, “and they‚” scil„ these equites : pro necessitudine, “on
account of the close relationship.’' Cicero was of an equestrian family.
4. Bithynice, “Of Bithynia,” which by the w111 of Nicomedes its last
king, was bequeathed to the Romans, s. c. 74. 5. Reynuan Ario

hospitably received Coesar, and had accompanied him against their com-
mon enemy Pharnaces, had not expected this treatment; and after Caesar
had quitted Asia, the king appears to have, somehow or other, expressed
his dissatisfaction (see Chap. ΙΙΙ.). But this does not seem to have been
the ground of accusation which was raised against him two years later;
for his grandson Castor charged him with having made an attempt on
the life of Caesar, at the time when the latter stayed with him for three
days; and Castor brought with him Phidippus, the king's physician, to
bear witness to the charge. As to what induced Castor to bring forward
this serious accusation, Cicero is silent ; but from other passages which
were written after Cicero’s death, we may conjecture that family disputes,
and especially the eruelty of Deiotarus, provoked his grandson to bring
this charge against him. Cicero, who had formed a friendship with Deio-
tarus at the time when he was governor of Cilicia, undertook his defence;
and, B. c. 45, he delivered the present oration in the house of Caesar, in
the presence of the ambassadors of Deiotarus (see Chap. XV.)‚ and of the
accusers. Afterwards he wrote down the speech and sent it to his
friend. He endeavors to set forth the unprecedented and incredible na-
ture of the charge, especially by identifying the impracticability of such
a plan, with its non-execution. In enumerating the great services ren-
dered by Deiotarus to Pompcy, Caesar, and the Roman state (Chaps. 111.—
V.), he describes him as a very venerable old man, of a very excellent
character, who could not possibly have been capable of such an act;
which, moreover, would have been planned in an extremely stupid man-
ner, if it had been devised in the way stated by the accuser. He charges
the accuser with extreme impudenee and falsehood‚ and in conclusion
appeals to the mercy of Caesar.

We are not distinctly insormed what the result of this defence was,
but we have reason to believe that Caesar did not press the matter any
further. Deiotarus remained in possession of his tetrarchy, but did not
recover Lesser Armenia in the lifetime of Caesar, who, as Cleero (Phil. II.
37) says, always hated Deiotarus. After the murder of Caesar, however,
Deiotarus recovered his possession, and took cruel vengeance on the
parents of Castor, whom he ordered to be mul-dered. Castor himself
escaped, and, after the death of Deiotarus, obtained possession of a pait
of Galatia.

This speech is not so energetic and impressive as that for Ligarius, to
which it bears some resemblance in the treatment of the subject. Cicero
himself, in one of his letters, does not speak very favorably of it, and
describes it as lightly dashed off, and without any great depth, probably
because he was obliged to pass over many things in silence.

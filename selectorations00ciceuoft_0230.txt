Dictator (Caesar), that his life was most dear and valuable to all, since on
it depended the tranquillity of the state, and the hopes of the restoration
of the commonwealth.” Dzmlop’s Rom. Lit.

Though this oration was made on the spur of the occasion, and
abounds in oratorical exaggerations too glai-ing for the taste of modern
times, yet for elegance of diction, vivacity of sentiment, and politeness
of compliment‚ it is superior to any thing extant of the kind in all
antiquity. It was delivered in the year of Rome 707, Β. c. 46, and in
the 6151: of Cicero's age.

This oration continued to be not only of undisputed authenticity‚ but
one of Cicero's most admired productions, till, in 1802, the question of its
authenticity was raised by Wolf, and discussed by Wolf, Spalding, and
Schiitz, on the onc side, and Wormius, Weiske, and Jacob, on the other.
New light was thrown on this subject in 1817, when, among the discove—
ries of Maio, was found a collection of scholia on several of the orations
of Cicero, and among them on that for Marcellus. The question of its
authenticity is now considered as conclusively settled.

NOTES.

l·—l. Diuturm‘ silentii, dc, “Of the long silence which Ι had
observed 111 these times.” Ever since his return to Rome, aster being
pardoned by Caesar for the part he had taken in favor of Pompey, now
more than a year, Cicero had taken no active part in public affairs, 1111
1116 generosity of Caesar, in pardoning Marcellus at the request of the
senate, now forced him to break this silence, in giving expression to his
admiration of Caesar’s conduct, and joy at the favor shown to his friend.
This is addressed partly to the senate, and partly to Caesar‚ then present.
—For this silence he assigns the reasons which follow. 2. Non
timore aliquo, “Not from any sear ;'' from that, his coufidence in the
justice and liberality of Caesar had relieved him: partim dolore,
“partly from grief ;'’ becaus‘ »f the situation of Marcellus, see below:
partim verecundia, “partly from shame,’⁷ or the embarrassment he
could not but feel, if he should speak in the senate, in the presence of
Caesar, against whom he so lately contended, and by whom he had been
, so generously pardoned. 3. Blodum, “Moderation:” tam de-
nique, (xc. Ari-ange, denique sapientiam (object of prseterire) tam incre-
dibilem ac poene dizdnam: tacitus, “111 51161166.” Β. ᾧ 98, Obs. 10.—

FIRST ORATION AGAINST cAr1L1NE. 161

serre aliquid ad senatum is the usual phrase for laying a matter before
the senate for its consideration and decision. 8. Non referam, “l
will not refer it.’' (To do so is) id quod, dte„ “a thing which is repugnant
to my character.” XVhen as here a relative refers to a verb, or a whole
proposition, it is neuter, and in such a case id quod is generally used in-
stead of quod. 9. Quid est, Catilina? We may suppose Cicero to
have paused a little after giving the preceding bold orde-r, to see if the
senate'sanctioned it, as he was confident they would, and then address-
ing Catiline, he says: Quid est, Catilina? “What is this, Catiline2” i. e.,
what is the meaning of this silence? ecquid attendis? “are you at-
tending to it2”—Ecqu2·d is used in impassioned interrogation, merely as
an interrogative particle like an, num, Aac„ but more emphatic, and of
course has no corresponding word in the translation. 10. Quid.
“Why” 11. P. Sestio, “To P. Sestius.'’ This was P. Sestius Gallus,
who was quaestor of C. Antonius. M. Marcello. This Marcellus
was consul B. o. 51, and was defended in an oration by Cicero before
Caesar. See Oration for Marcellus, in this collection. He was a very dif-
ferent person from the M. Marcellus mentioned above: hoc ipso in
templo, “in this very tcmple:'' vim et manus, “their violence and
their hands,” i. e., “violent hands” de te autem, “ but with regard to
you.’' 12. Videlicet, “Of course,'’ “f01s00t11,'⁷used ironically:
vita vilissima, “ but their life of no value.’' 13. Quorum tu et frequen-
tiam, &a Arrange thus 2—quorum tu potuisti et videre frequentiam, ὥρη
“Of whom thou couldst both see the numbcr‚’' &a 14. Ut te haee, dxc„
arrange thus, U t prosequantur usque ad portas te relinquentem kcec (maenia)
quae, dte„ viz: “follow to the gatcs‘' (as a friendly escort). When persons
went into exile their friends usually followed them as far as the gates of

the city.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.-1. Quamquam, “And yet.’' 2. Te ut ulla res franyat?
As the conjunction ut marks this, and the two following, as dependent
clauses, supply credendumne sit fore, or some such expression, and render,
“Can it be believed that,” dte. 3. Duint, an old form for dent.
4. Tametsi videm video has for its object the whole clause quanta tem-
pestas ...... impendeat: si minus, “if not.'’ 5. Sed est tanti,
lit, “it is of so much value‚'' i. e., ‘⁴ I esteem it a light thing,'' probably
accompanying the word with a snap of the finger, or smne such gesture,
indicating how little he cared for such a stoi-nu as much asto say, “I
care notl for that:” dummodo ista privata sit calann'tas, “provideo
that calamity of which you are the cause (such is the force of ista) be
private'' (i. e. confined to Cicero). 6. Sed ιιι ut, dxc. These clauses,

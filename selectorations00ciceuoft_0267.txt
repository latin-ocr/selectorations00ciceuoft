Deiotarus and his son:—Render litei-ally. 7. Dabis profecto, &cn
“You will undoubtedly grant to compassion, what you have refused to
anger.'' The meaning of this sentence is not very obvious, and of course
it has been variously interpreted, but not very satisfactorily, so far as I
have seen. Another may be hazarded. In the preceding sentence Cicero
brings forward the case of the son evidently to aid his plea in behalf of
the father. If the latter had offended, the former had not, and yet the
refusal to aequit the father would greatly distress the son. Does not this
sentence then mean? “You will surely grant from compassion to the son,
that which you have hitherto refused from displeasure with the fathe1·.'’
This view is confirmed by what is said in the beginning of the next
chapter. 8. Sed maxime eorum incolumitates, “But especially the
security of thosess’ Abstract nouns are sometimes used in the plural,
when that which they express belongs to more than one. 9. chce si,
“If these,” scil„ monumenta clementiae tuae: in privatis, “in the case
of those in private life.’'

“Who lately with Hiera was sent to you as an ambassador of the most
friendly of kings.'' Whether this Dorylaus was now au ambassadox· of
Deiotarus, cannot be ascertained from the text. It is probable he was
not, but from his intimacy with Hiera, with whom he had before come as
joint ambassador from a friendly sovereign (supposed to be Ariobarzanes,
king of Cappadocia), he united his influence with that of Hiera in behnlf
of Deiotarus. 4. Et criminibus illis, dxc„ “And in reg-ard to these

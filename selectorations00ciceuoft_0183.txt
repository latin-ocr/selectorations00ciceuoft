nitoe studium, “ For the pul-suit of this kind of life :’' qui feruntur
“ which are extolled‚” ‘⁴ published abroad,” (viz. by your friends):
medetati sunt, “ were p1·actised.’' 6. <Iacere humi, (namely) “ Your
lying on the ground.” This and vigilare are in a sort of apposition with
labores, specifying the kind of labore which his friends were aecustomed
to admire in Catiline. They meant his indifferencc about accommoda—
tion, and his readiness to share the toils of the common soldier, by laying
himself down on the ground to sleep, οι· depriving himself of sle-ep
(vigyihzre), as circumstances might require. The words ad obsidendmn
stuprum (“ to lie in waitz for debauchery:'')—ad facinus obezmzltmz,——
. insidiantem somno, dxc„ are to be considered as the commentary of Cicero
giving a very different turn to these “ labors‚‘’ which, however, is in per-
fect keeping with the character of Catiline. See that drawn at full length
by‚Sallust-‚ Cat.. 5: bonis, “the goods‚” ‘⁴ p1·operty.'' 7. Habes
(locum) ubi ostentes, “ You have now a field in which you may display.’'
This is irony: te confectum csse, “that you have been ruined,’⁷—
‘⁴ are undone.’' S. Quum te α consulatu repuli.—A few days before
the delivery of this oration, viz„ on the 21st Oct„ when Catiline was for
the third time a candidate for the consulship, he was defeated by the
exertions of Cicero, who, the morning before, exposed his treasonable
designs to the senate, and, in the Campus Martius, that day during the
election, wore, under his eloak, a coat of mail to defend himself from tha
fury of Catiline. This was seen and understood by the people, which
kindlcd such a blaze of indignation against Catiline, that he was defeated.
This roused him to that desperation which he manifested in eonducting
this conspiracy against his country. See the introduction to this oration.
9. Ut exsul potius, &c ; Observe the antitheses herc between exsul
and consul,-— latrocinium and bellum. Latrociuium means “an attack

by robbcns.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

XI.-1. ZVunc, Patres conscripti.—-Cicero now addresses himself di-
rectly to the senate, and requests them, instead of eensuring him, to give
him their eal-nest, attention to what he had to say in his own justification,
for the style of remark in which he had spoken to Catiline in their pre-
sence, ordering him to leave Rome, instead os seizing him, and ordei-ing
him to immedIate execution, as he might have done. 2. Ut α me
detester ac deprecer, “That I may earncstly deprecate and avert (as an
evil) from myself.” No stronger tei-ms could be used to express the
earnestness of Cicero on this occasion. 3. Si mecum patria ......
loquatur, ‘¹ If my country ...... should say to me.” Of the pro-
tasio which begins here, and is continued to the end of this cha-pter,

¹⁴ that it may be a ground of great, censure against me? (B. ᾧ 140, Obs. 6.—
A. ‹lz S. ᾧ 262. Rem. 7.): quod, “ that, &c.” This clause is the proper
subject of sit. 8. Quum prefectus sit, “ Since (now that) he has gone
forth.” Observe the antithesis between profectus and iutevfeetua
9. Quamquam isti, dxc. Observe here again the contempt expressed by
isti and istorum, applied to these persons because they were the secret
friends of Catiline, and the enemies of their country: (licinum, “ are
ever repeating,” a double frequentative: verentur, sci1.; because by
his going into exile their common designs would be frustrated.

vnn—1. Et ipsos placare, “And to reeoneile them.” 2· Istoe
copiae, dvc„ “These miserable forces are made up.’' Six classes of men
are described in this and the two following sections, from which the
troops of Catiline were taken. 3. Deinde sinyulis, “Then to each '’
(of these classes), one by one: consilii, (hc, “of my advice and
exhortationff’ Si quam potere, = si quam (indes.) medicinam afferre
potero. 4. Allayno in aere alieno, “(Involved) in great debt:'’
possessiones, “estates.” These men have estates of more value than the
amount of their debts, and yet, so great is their attachment to them, that,
dissolvi nullo modo poema—“they ean in no way be separated
from them,” i. e., they will not sell them, nor any part of them,
to pay their debts; and hence to get rid of these they join the
sortunes of Catiline, who had promised them (novas tabulas) “an aboli-
tion of debts” 5. Species cst honestissima, “The outward appearance
is highly respectable.” They take a high standing in society, appear to

ommes For. T. Asinus Mino. 999

xxm—l. Asana vero cur miserit? by tmesis, for cur vero manmniser-
ic? 2. Nescis iniwnici sactum reprehendere, ‘⁴ You do not know how to
find fault with the conduct of your enemy.'’ If you did, instead of blamiug
him for manumitting his slaves, you would blame him rather for not re-
warding them niore liberally. In support of this ho introduces the opinion
of Μ. Cato, now sitting on this trial, given by him on another occasion.
3. Propter quos, “through whose means'’===per qnoe. A. Quos nisi
manumisisset, “But unless he had set them free:” defensores neeis,
‘⁴ the averters of his death.'' This is the strict meaning of defensor.
5. Quam . . . esse tamen illis, &e.‚ “Thau that a desei-ved reward has
nevertheless been conferi-ed on them’' (the slaves): etiamsi quid
ipsi accidat, “even if any thing (i. e., any calamity) should befall himself.’'
6. Sed quoestz'ones, ἀφ, “But (it is said) the examinations (viz.‚ of
slaves by torture) which are now going on in the hall of Liberty, bear
hard on Milo ; i. α, their testimony is strong against him.⁷⁷ The worthlcss-
ness of such testimony, and the injustice, because partiality, of such proee-
durc, he exposes at the end of the chapter. But herc, adroitly represent-
ing the guilt of Clodius as already proved, he intimatos that if the slaves
speak only the truth, instead of testifying against Milo, they will testify
against their own master, which was contrary to the Roman laws, except
in case of incest, in which Clodius was eoncerned before. This turn of
course leads him to speak of Clodius, though dead, as if he were alive and
on his trial; and it is moreover putting his death on a level with a wiola-
tion of the myster-ies of religion. 7. ΑΙ) Appio= ab οι· ex Appii do-
mo. See above, Ch. XIX„ Note 9. 8. Proxime (acl) deos accessit
Clodius, ἀει, “ Clodius has made a very near approach to the gods (soll,
in dignity), nearer than when he had penetrated to the gods themselves?
——referring to his violatIng the myst-eries of Bona dea nt Caesar's house.
Here it will be noticed that propius is used in a double sense: tam-
quam, “as ;'' the point of resemblance is, that in both, the slaves are made
to testify against their master. 9. Νοίαενιιηί, “Did not allow :'’
dominis morte ipsa tristius, “worse ‘to their masters than death itself.’'
lo. Aye vero, “But come.” He proceeds to exhibit the value of
that testimony as against Milo, by a specimen of the examination itself.
ll· Heus tu, Rufio, “Come soi-ward, Rufio'’ (the name of a slave):
verbi causa, ‘⁶ sor example :’' cave sis atentiam, “take care, if
you please, that you do not lie? Ne is often omitted before the subjunc-
tive after caveo: cis, a colloquial eontraction for si vis. 12. Quid
Ιιαι· quaestione certius? “What is more certain than such examinationi P'
This question and the following are put ironically, meaning, “ean any
thing be less certain? less worthy of credit 2’'

potuerit as its antecedent. 7. Ut enim, “For although:” Lanu-

pose that he did bribe a slave.” Concessions made for the sake of ar-
gument only. B. § 45, iii. 4.—A. da S. ᾧ 260. ii.‚ Rem. 3. 10. Legyite
testimonia, nhc„ “ Read the testimony of your own witnessesff' This testi-
mony was taken two or three days before. He refers to the testimony
of C. Cassinius Schola, the value of which might be inferred froin the
fact of his testifying, that Clodius was at Interamna and at Rome (places

80 Roman miles apart) at the same honr. However, passing this, the

that day was to have remained at his country-seat near Alba. &css’
On this testimony Cicero comments at length in the two following chap—
ters, showing from it the truth of his main position, ‘that Clodius lay in
wait for Milo?

 

xum—1. Quantoe res, «tc. “How important facts are proved bv
these testimouies‚” viz., that the return of Clodius to Rome, at the time
referred to, was purely aecidental, the effect of circumstances not known
beforehand even by Clodius himself. Milo of course could not know of
his return beforehand, could not expect to meet him.there, and conse-
quently could not intend to lie in wait for him. The same thing 'proves
contrary to the insinuations of Cicero's enemies, that he could have no
concern in this affair. 2. Liberatur‚ “is set free‚‘’ ⁴· is proved inno-
cent :'' non profectus esse,- supply probatur, “he is proved not to

ceding statement), “ nndoubtedly‚'' or, “this must be so.” 3. In leae
royaez'one suadenda, ‘⁴ In urging forward the bill for this triul.’⁷
4. Jacent, suis testibus Ιιὶ, “These (men who speak thus) are prostrated

“ For that objection meets me.” The witness referred to, stated that Clo-¹
dius intended to remaiu at his Alban vina all night, if the death of
Cyrus had not been suddenly and unexpectedly announced to him. The
prosecution intended by this to prove that Clodius did not wayln y Milo, as,
but sor this intelligence, he would have been at his villa, and not on the
way to Rome. To this, Cicero replies by suggesting that the business of
the messenger was probably far different; that, instead of announcing the

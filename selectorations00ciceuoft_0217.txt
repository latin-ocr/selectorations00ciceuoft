citizen, and attempted to drive him from the city. It unfortunately hap-
pened, that, in opposition to this charge, he was unable to furnish any legal
documents to prove his right of citizenship, as the archives of Heraclia
had been destroyed by fire; and for some reason or other, during liis
stay at Rome, his name as a citizen had not been entered on the census
lists. Cicero uudertook his defence, and 111 the absence of legal proofs
enlarged on the dignity of literature and poetry, on the genius and ae
complishments of Archias, on the benefits which the state as well as him-
self had derived from his litei-ary productions‚ and on these grounds
maintained that even if he had not been a Roman citizen, such wore his
merits, it was their duty to make him one, and secure him to the state,
rather than,f01· the want of technical evidence, to deprive him of the
rights to which he was justly entitled.

This is one of the orations of Cicero on which he has succeeded in be-
stowing the finest polish; it is perhaps the most pleasing of all his ha-
rangues, and is interspersed with beautiful maxims and sentences, which
have been quoted with delight in all ages. It was delivered before the
praetor Quintus Cicero, the brother of the orator, A. U. O. (392, B. c. ol,
when Cicero was in the forty-sixth year of his age. The result of this
trial is unknown, and the remaining period of the life of Archias is‘buried
in utter obscurity; but the eloquence and beauty of this oration, as well
as its commendations of elegant literature (humaniora), will ever render it
“a useful, agreeable, and inciting study to young readers.”

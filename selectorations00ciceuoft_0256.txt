and losses,⁷' viz„ of Trocmi and Lesser Armenia. See Introd. 2. Tum

patliy to Deiotarus, they might suppose that: their course against him
would secure to them the friendship of Caesar. The reflexive sibi, in a
dependent clause, as here, commonly refers to the subject of the leading
verb. B. ᾧ 28, Obs, 3. lst.—A. ἅ* S. §208 (1). 3. Quumque apud ipsum

10. Cui tamen ipsi rei, “ Which very thing, however,” viz„ his pre-

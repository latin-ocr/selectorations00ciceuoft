distinguished himself in it, almost without interruption, down to his death,
displaying his skill and talent in the most varied circumstances, and stand-
ing forth as the greatest orator among his contemporaries. His orations—-
of which fifty-six have come down to us—are the mirror of his political
career, and of the most important events of his lise, and are at the same
time the most brilliant monuments of Latin prose. The fulness and
harmony of his thoughts, the masterly manner and clearness with which he
handles his subjects, the transparency and variety of forms, the overflowing
and brilliant rhetorical diction, and the simple, unaffected narrative—al}
these qualities excite our admiration, and are found combined in each of
his orations; although. according to the opinions of ancient and modern
critics, one or other may not have received his last and finishing hand.
The extant orations form only the smaller part of his literary productions;
we have, besides, a number of rhetorical and philosophical writings-—of
which it is unnecessary in this place to mention the titles—-and an exceed-
ingly rich collection of letters, which to us are the best pragmatical history
of his age, and together with the orations, constitute the most authentic
commentary on his life. Cicero himself willingly acknowledges that the
Greeks—such as Plato, Demosthenes, and their great poets and histor-ians-

were his instructors and superiors3 and his incessant study of the master-
works of -the Greeks has unmistakably stamped upon his own writings the
impress of universality and greatness—nay, in his orations he has perhaps
even surpassed his models.

The Orations in this collection are among the most finished and beauti-
ful that Cicero ever delivered, and refer to some of the most important
events in the history of his time. They furnish a fair specimen of his
extraordinary powers as an orator, and are a proof that the author, as a
man, is deserving of the highest praise that can be bestowed upon human
exertions, and that, amid all the evils and temptations by which he was
surrounded, he maintained his character pure and undefiled.

Soon after his first public appearance as an orator, and after he had
already acquired a name and reputation, he left Rome on the advice of his
sriends; and for the purpose of strengthening his health, travelled through
Greece and Asia Minor, where he formed acquaintances and friendships
with the most celebrated rhetoricians and philosophers. On his return he
offered himself as a candidate for the quaestmship, and at the age of
thirty, B. 0:75, went as quaestor to Lilybaeum in Sicily, under the praetor
Sex. Peducaeus. In the year Β. c. 69, Cicero obtained the aedileship, and
three years later, B. c. 66, he was praetor urbanus. While invested with
this office, he delivered, among other speeches the splendid oration for the
Manilian bill (pro leye spsanilia). The veneration for Pompey which he

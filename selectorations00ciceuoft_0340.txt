Tne immense sale of Dr. Comstock’s books, renders it probable thaz
thoy are familiar to most teaehers. They ure so admirably adapted to
tlte school-room, that the “Philosophy'' has been republished in several
Enropean countries. Revised editions of several of these works have
been reeently issued, including late discoveries and improvement-2

Comstoek’s Natural Philosol‘diy having been earefully examined by
the Edinburgh and London Editors, previous to its republication in
these eities, all the corrections or additions which they found it advisable
to make have been incorporated in the original work—so far as they
were ascen-tained to be judicious and adapted to our system of instruo
tion. This philosophy now appears as in reality the work of three accom-
plished authors, endorsed and sanetioned by the great majority of Amer-
(can tenebere, as well as those of Enghznd, Seotland and Prussia. The
Cannis-mr has been entirely revised‚ und contains all the late discoveries,
together with the methods of analyzing minei-als and metals

·> 2. BROCKLESBY‘S ELEMENTS OF METEOROLOGY, with qnes-
tlons for Examination, desig-ned sor Schools and Academies. Of thiu
work, Prof. Olmstead, of Yale Collega, snysz—“No nanu-al seienee in
more insu-notive, more atti-active, and more practically nsefnL than Me-
teorology‚ treated as yon have treated it; where the philosophie-‘xl ex
planations of tln: various plu-nomena ol* the atmosplnere are founded
upon an extensive indnction of facts. This scicnce is inore particularly
interesting to the young, because it explains so many things that aro
daily occurring nronnd them, and it thus inspires a toste sor philosophica]
observation, nnd what is inore, sor philosophica] reasoni11g. I think it
(cannot fail to be received as a valuable addition to our Text Books.”

3. BROCKLESBY'S VIEWS OF THE MICROSCOPIC WORLD.—
An elegantly illustratet] work, exhibiting a variety of insonte}¹ animal
eules, sections of wood, crystalizations, &Q as they appear when highly
magnified. Tlns is one of the most interesting and uscful books foi
Fuinily and School Libraries ever publishod. It is the only distinct trea
lise on the subject, is admirably prepared for the use of classes. anti
=¹wuld be extensively taught in our schools.

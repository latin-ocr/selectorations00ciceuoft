before all his associatus were assembled, and the few who were present
had not the courage to attempt any thing. An inquiry into this affair was
dropped, because thc senate had neither sufficient evidence nor (ourage to
act with the necessary energy, and it is possible, also, that a striet inquii-y
might have involved some of the senators themselves.

The year after this, Catiline escaped from another accusation sor his
concern in the proscriptions of Sulla. Though one of the most seriously
implicated‚ by the connivance of Julius Caesar, who was then quoestm· inter
sicarios, he was saved, while others less guilty were punished. This
indulgence only encouraged Catiline to give way the more to his propen-
sities, so dangerous to the republic, and au good citizens3 and in addition ⁸
to this, he was urged on by his debts, his associates, and his ambition.

Catiline again offered himself as a candidate for the consulship for the
year B. c. 63. He promised his friends, that if he should succeed, he would
remove all grievances from the republic3 that all differences between poor
and rich, high and low, should cease3 that he would bring about a general
cancelling of debts and the proscription of the wealthy·, and that all the
offices of the state, as well as sacerdotal dignities, should be given to his
confederates (Sallust Cat.² ᾧῷ 20, 21). These promises as well as those to
whom they were made, soon became known. Q. Curius, one of Catiline's
associatos, communicated the scheme to Fulvia, a dissolute woman, and she
spread the secret further. The knowledge of this plot immediately had
its influence on the electioris. Cicero was unanimously elected consul, and
C. Antonius defeated Catiline by a majority of a few votes.

Catiline, however, not disheartened‚ again tried to obtain the consulship
for 1118 following year (Β. c. 6⁶2), having previously greatly increased the
number of his followers and friends, by the addition of various malcontents
and desperadocs. As he had failed by lawsul means, hc determined to
carry his point by force of arms. He sought and found adherents in Rome;
and, especially in Etruria, great numbers flocked around the centurion, C.
Manlius, a veteran of the tinne of Sulla : he was stationed at Faesulae, and
soon had an army ready to fight. In Rome itself, Catiline made every
effort to win the favor os the lower orders. People suspected and dreaded
his plans: the laws against bribery were made more stringent, and the
consular elections, which ought to have taken place at the end of July,
were put off to the ‘zoth of October, and afterwards to the alst. Cicero,
who was ever watchful of his movements, had openly shown to Catiline
his suspicions of him; but after he again received a detailed account of the
plans of the conspirators from Q„ Curius and Fulvia, 118 boldly came for—
ward in the senate, and drew the attention of the house to the existence
of the treasonable plot. In the night following, Cicero, through means of

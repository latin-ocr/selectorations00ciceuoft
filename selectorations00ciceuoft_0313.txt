Obs, 6.- A. &S (2205, Rem. 7, (2). The indicative fait shows the op-
portunity actually occurred, though it was not improved. This is ren-
dered in English as if it were the subjunctive. Supply fuit in the same
sense with yloria. 8. In campo, “In the Campus Ma1·tius‚'’a plain o'n
the banks of the Tiber where public asseinblies of the people were held
for electione, &ez in septa irrupisset, “had forced his way into the
euelosure.” The septa was an enclosure like a sheepfold, hence called
ovile, into which the people in their eenturies in succession went to give
their votes. The access to it was by a narrow passage or bridge to pre-
vent confusion. Into this Clodius violently forced his way to prevent
the elections from being eornpleted. 9. Vota fizceretis, “Pi-ayed‚”
“offered prayers with vows to the gods.’' B. ᾧ 102, Obs. 3.—A. ὦ S.

ing Clodius.

 

 

 

 

xvl.—1. Quem ἰφύων, ὥς. Arrange and supply: (Num) iyitur voluit
(occidere) cum querela aliquorum, hunc, quem noluit (occidere) cum qratia
munium .? So in the next clause. The obvious answer to these interroga-
tories is, ‘It is impossible.‘
he amplifies the alieno tempore in the preceding effinse, showing that if
Milo manifested no disposition to slay Clodius, when the time was favora-
ble for doing so, it could not be supposed for a mome⁰nt he could enter-
tain sueh a design, when the time was particularly unfavorable. How it
was so, he goes on to show: amplissimi honoris eontentio, dvc„ “the
contest for the highest honor,'' viz„ the consulship for which Milo was
then a candidate. The following picture of the anxiety and uneasiness
of those who are candidates sor office intimes of excitement, and in a
closely contested election, is highly graphic, and was often realized, es
peeinlly at Rome, where the people‚ always municione, were influenced
more by favor than by regal-d to principle, and where of course not only
was every art resorted to in order to win their favor, but the greatest
care was necessary to avoid any thing which might possibly incur their
displeasure. 3. Sed etiam in recte jectis fastidiunt, “But are often
disgusted even with his good deeds.'⁷ 1. Diem campi, “The day of
the election,” lit., “of the Campus Martius :¹⁵ prce se ferens, “openly
showing,“ scil„ by his acts: confitens, “ac-knowledging,” scil„ in
words: scelus et facinus. These words of similar meaning are put
together, to express the dal-ing wickedness of the act referred to. Scelus
alone means a wicked action; facinus, a bold or during aetion. Observe
the antithesis between these words. and illa αυφιεὶα auspicia centuriarum,

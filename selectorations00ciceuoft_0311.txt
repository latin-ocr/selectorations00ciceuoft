erat, ut odisset, dm, “There was (reason) why he (Clodius) „hould hate
(Mi10,) first of an as the protector of my safety‚ &c.‚'’ i. e., ‘⁴ because he
was the protector, &ef It was mainly through the efforts of Milo that
Cicero was recalled from exile. Three reasons are here assigned for the
hatred of Clodius against Milo-——his efforts in behalf of Cicero, his suc-
cessful opposition to the outrages of Clodius, and his being his accuser.
u. Reus enim stlilonis, dxc„ “ For he lay under Milo’s accusation as
long as he lived,‘’ lit„ “he was Milo’s accused.‘’ The accusation was
lodged against him under the Plotian law against violence, but the matter
was never brought to trial. 15. Quantum odium illius (creditis)—
foez'sse? “How great was his resentment’' (think you)? viz, against Milo:
quam justum, “with how much reasonY'

 

 

 

XIV.—1. Reliquum est, “ It remains.” Having discussed the question
‘whose interest it was' (cui bono), Ch. XII„ Note 2, and the argument
from personal hatred in the close of the preceding chapter, he now goes
on to argue from their respective 'dispositione and general course of con-
duct, that, on the question, ‘which of the two lay in wait for the other 2’
the probability is strongly in favor of Milo and against Clodius: ut
illum natura ipsius, dvc„ “ that the nature of the man himself and his habit
of life may defend the one (Clodius) and 'conviet the other (Milo).” This
sentence and the next are ironical. 2. Urbe cessi, “ I departed from
the city,” viz„ into exile: non servos, &ci “ and not his slaves, &c ?'’
dependent on timui, interrogatively. When Cicero was placed in the po-
s'ition of a criminal by a law of Clodius, for bringing to desei-ved pun·
ishment the accomplices of Catssine, as was customary, he put on mourn-
ing, and went about the streets to move ‘the compassion of the people;
but he was met every where, and insulted by the slaves of Clodius. This
induced him to go into voluntary exile, without waiting for a trial. The
senators, to testify ‘their regard for him, put on mourning (moerentibus
vobis). 3. Restituendz· mei, “Of recalling me,” scil, from exile:
ejiciendi, “of thrusting me out,'’ viz.‚ by lawless violence. 4. Diem
mihi credo, dixerat, “He had, I suppose, appointed a day for me'' (for trial
before the people): multam irrogarat, dxc„ “he had proposed a fine,
he had threatened an action of treason:’' videlicet, “forsooth” All
this is spoken ironically‚ to express his contempt for the proceedings of
Clodius against him. 5. Quum mihi adesset, “When he took part
with me'’ Q, Hortensius was a celebrated orator, and though for a time
the rival of Cicero, this never interfered with their friendship. WVheu
he and C. Curio were sent to the consul Gabinius to get him to inter-
pose his authority ln favor os Cicero, they were rudely repulsed by him,

ORATION F ΟΒ KING DEIOTARUS.

INTRODUCTION.

DaroTAnus, Tetrarch—that is, one of the four princes—of Galatia, a
country of Asia Minor, between Cappadocia, Phrygia, Bithynia, and Pn-

Alexandrine war to a successful issue; he went to Asia Minor to attack
Pharnaces, who had encroached upon Roman territory, and injured Ro-

humble manner, and sued for mercy. Caesar pardoned him, and allowed
him to retain his kingly title; but did not restore to him his former pos

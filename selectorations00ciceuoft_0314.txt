lit, “those august auspices of the centuri‹e.” The holding ot' the comi-
tia centuriata was preceded by the religions ceremony of taking the au-
spices to ascertain whether the gods approved. If the auspices were fa-
vorable‚ the election proceeded3 if not, it was postponed3 and hence the
Campus Martius was for the time considered as consecrated ground. To
come to such a place with an open declaration of such guilt, Cicero inti-
mates, is a wickedness so gross and heaven-daring as not to be thought
of in Milo, who had a revel-enee for the gods. 5. Quam hro ‘non
credibile in hoc! “How incredible is this in this inan !'’ (Milo): quam
non dubitandum idem in Clodio, “how clearly not to be doubted is the
same thing in Clodius:” qni putaret, “since he thought.’‘
6. Quid? quod caput esc audaciae, (ke, “that will you say as to that
which is the great source of andacity,” namely, the hope of impunity.
By showing there could be no such hope to Milo, but that there was to
Clodius, seeing hc had in former instances contrived to escape mcrited
punishment, and dclighted only in what was contrary to all laws, divine
or human, he frames another, which is the fourth argument in favor of

 

 

 

 

Milo und against Clodius on the main question, ‘which lay in wait for
the otherZ’ 7. Sed quid egyo aryzmzentor? “But why do Ι produce
argnments.” They were unnceessal·y; and he goes on to state, and ap-
peals to some of the judges by name for their knowledge of the fact, that
Clodius said, that on the third day Milo would pei-ish, which answered
precisely to the tiinc the reneounter took place, showing that Clodius in-
tended to carry his threat into effect, and waylaid Milo for this purpose.
This may be called the fifth argument.

 

xva—1. Quemadmodum iyitur, &c.‚ “How then could he certainly
know the day?'' He had said, as just mentioned, ‘the third day.’ How·
could he fix on this time? In answer to this question, Cicero goes on to
show, that, while Clodius could not but know that Milo had to be on his
way to Lanuvium that day, Milo could not know that Clodius would be
out of the city, especially as a seditious meeting was to be held where
his presence was so necessary, and there was no known reason for his
leaving it. The bearing of this fact on the question, uter utri insidia„
fecit? is obvious.

 

2. Dixi equidem modo, viz„ Ch. X which see.
3. Itaque antevertit, “Therefore‚ he took the start of him,” “placed
himself before him.’' 4. Nisi ad coyitatnm facinus approperaret,
“Unless he was hastening to effect his intended villainy.” 5. Eryo
illi, “To him, then-estne? sc. Clodius: manendi nulla facultas, “there
was no possibility of remaining (in the city).'’ 6. Qui scire potuerit?

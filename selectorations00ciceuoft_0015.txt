shewed on that occasion was entertained by him throughout his life.
Having Caesar before his eyes, he could not but look upon Pompey as the
pillar of the republic and the old aristocracy ; but whether he was right in
so doing, is a question which, considering the historical facts of the case, it
is difficult to decide. Pompey was no less ambitious and anxious to obtain
power than his great opponent, and his defeat could raise him only in the
eyes of one who was an enthusiastic admirer of the ancient forms of the
republic.

In B. c. 63, when he was forty-three years old, Cicero obtained the
consulship; and that year forms the acme of his political activity. The
discovery and suppression of the Catiliuarian conspiracy procured for him
the gratitude of all well—disposed Romans, and the love of the people; but
at the same time drew upon him the hatred of many of the nobles. In his
speeches against Oatiline, Cicero often alludes to the secret friends os
Catiline, and to the dangers to which he was exposing himself by his
resolutely combatiug the conspirators. His apprehensions became speedily
realized; for a few years later, he was crushed by the intrigues of the
tribune P. Clodius, who, favored even by Caesar, aceused him of having,
in his consulship, caused Roman citizens (the accomplices of Catilinc) to
be put to death, contrary to law, and without a trial; and who, in spite 01
the reluctance of the people, caused—in conjunction with thc consuls
L. Calpurnius Piso and A. Gabinius—Cicero to be exiled, B. c. 58, having
previously carried a law by which these proceedings became legalized.
During his exile, Cicero resided at Thessalonica with the quaestor Cn.
Plancius; but he returned after an absence of sixteen months; and the
hearty welcome which he met with was a compensation and consolation
for the wrong he had suffered.

The history of the years which then foll( :ved is best illustrated by his
letters·, they show how he watched the steps of Caesar, and how he
judged of the course of events. His attaching himself more and more
closely to the party of Pompey was no more than consistent. After the
death of M. Crassus, who had fallen in the war against the Parthians,
Cicero, by the unanimous desire of the augurs, became a member of their
college, a dignity to which only the first and most tried men of the republie
were admitted. Two years after this he also displayed his talents as a.
military commander; for having obtained the proconsular administration
of the province of Cilicia, he defended that country so successfully against
the attacks of tho Parthians, that after he had defeated the enemy in a
decisivo battle at the foot of Moun‘t Amanus, his soldiers saluted him with
the title of imperator. This happened B. o. 51, and the senate honored

him on his return with a triumph.

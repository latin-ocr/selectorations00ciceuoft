FOURTH ORATlON AGAINST CATILJNE.

INTRODUCTION.

Tin: fourth Catilinarian oration was delivered in the senate on the 5th
of December. A desigu had been formed to liberate, by main force, the
criminals who had been ari-ested on the 3d: Cicero therefore summoned
a meeting of the Senate on the 5th, and proposed the question as to what
was to be done with the prisoners. According to established cnstom, Si-
lanus, the consul elect, had the right to express his opinion first. His
advice was to put the conspiratores to death. After him many others ex-
pressed their coneum-enee in his opinion: but Julius Caesar endeavored
to show that perpetual banishment from Rome and captivity in the muni-
cipia was a inore appropriate punishment. Cicero, without declaring sor
any particular mode of punishment, evidently inclines to the opinion of
Silanus, in opposition to qthat of Caesar, by asserting the power of the
senate to pronounce the sentence of death, and at the same time descrih-
ing the crime itself, and the intentions of the criminals, in so strong colors,
that every one must have thought it precarious to allow such dangerous
persons to escape with their lives. Cicero was strongly supported by
Cato, who had been elected tribune of the people for the ensuing year,
and his opinion was adopted by the majority of the senators—The very
night aster these proceedings, the prisoners were strangled in their dun-
geon. The senate and people aceompanied Cicero home, calling him the
preserver of the Republie‚ and the father of his country. The honor and
joy of that day (Nonae Decembres) are often mentioned by Cicero iu his

subsequent speeches.

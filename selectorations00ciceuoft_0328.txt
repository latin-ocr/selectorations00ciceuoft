———- 9. Vobis illoe, vobis vestro, Ace„ “To you, to you and in your presence,
was that atoncment, late, but neverthelees just and proper, paid.” In
sight of these Clodius met his death. 10. Hoc ctiam casu factum
esse, “Thass this also happened by chancc,” namely, ut ante ipsum, ἀρ.
That such a remarkable coincidence should be the result of chance, and
not brought about by an overruling providencc, Cicero considers absurd:
ufiton absolutus judicio illo nefario videretur, “that it might appear
he was not acquitted by that infamous decree (viz., when tried for
violating the. mysteries of the Bona dea), but was reserved sor this signal
punielunenff’ Sce 111. Or. in Cat„ Ch. VIII„ Note 2.

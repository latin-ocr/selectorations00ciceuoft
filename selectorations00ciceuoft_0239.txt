ORATION FOR Q. LIGARIUS.

IN TRODUCTION.

IN the beginning of the year A. U. 703, B. c. 50, Q. Ligarius had gone
to Africa (the territory of Carthage) as legate of the praetor C. Considius
Longus, and having made himself popular with all (civibus et sociis), he
became, on the withdrawal of Considius, provisional governor and com-
mander of the province. At that moment the war between Caesar and
Pompey broke out, and the inhabitants of the province of Africa, most of
whom belonged to the party of Pompey, called upon Q. Ligarius, ‘to put

Varus, a decided Pompeian, who had just been defeated by the troops of
Caesar at Auximum in Picenum, arrived in Africa with a view to take the
supreme command in that province against Caesar. In this he succeeded
easily enough, and the more so, as he was sufficiently known in the prov-

soon after there arrived at Utica, L. Aelius Tubero, the lawful successor
of C. Considius, who had by lot received Africa for his province ·, but he
was not admitted either at Utica, or in any other part of Africa, and was
not even allowed to put on shore his sick son Q. Tubero, the accuser of
Ligarius. It may be that Q.. Ligarius, who was staying at Utica, carried
into effect this harsh proceeding of Varus against the 'Puberes The 1211-
ter (viz., the Tuberos) then went to Pornpey himself, and aftcr the unfor-
tunate battle of Pharsalus, B. c. 48, they were pardoncd by the. victorious
Oaesar. Ligarius still remained in Africa with the Pompeian party, which
offered such a desperate resistance to Caesar, that after their subjugation,
he felt little inclined to extend to them the pardon which he had granted

Deiotarus to attend to his interests at Rome. The other two were Hieras
and Antigonus, see Oh. XV. inquit, “ he (the accuser) says :''
maledicebat tibi, “ he (scil. Castor) attempted to slander you :'’
reyem, scil. Deiotarus. 4. Statua inter reyes posita, dic„ “Your statue
being placed‚'’ i. e., “ when your statue was placed among the kings.'’ The
statues of the seven king-s of Rome were placed in the Capitol. 5. Ezc
urbanis malevolorum sermunculis, “From the city gossip of evil-minded
persons :'' ab istis, “ by these men” (the accusers); iscis expresses con-
tempt. — 6. Blesamius tyranuum Caesarem scriberet ,ἵ “ Would Blesamius
write that Caesar was atyraut 2³⁷ This question with the verb in the imper-
fect subjunctive, implies a strong negative in the expected answer, “Most
certainly not, it is impossible ξ’ with the indicative it would denote uncertain-
ty, and ask for information. 7. Multorum euim, dxc„ ‘¹ He had seen per-
haps the heads of many citizens :’'—em'm is ironical. The meaning is just the
reverse of the expression—armatis militibus refertum forum, the irony is
still continued. So far from this being the case, Appian says that Caesar re-
moved from his person the Praetoriau eohorts3 and when urged to consult
his own sasety, and the interests of the state, by retaining around him a body
of armed rnen, he replied, “that he would rather die thau be feared.⁷’
8· Occiderit nemo nisi armatus. See Or. for Ligarius VI, Note 13, with refer-
ences. 9. Ιη reque, ‘⁴ In a monarchy‚’' viz„ under king Deiotarus.
10. Una, i. e., de una statua,—valde enim invidendum est, rho„ “ We who
have never been displeased at his trophies, must be greatly shocked, to be
sure, at his statues? Enim here again is ironical. ll. Nam si locus,
dm, “ But if the place occasions displeasure (scil, the capitol), no place cer-
tainly is more conspicuous sor a statue thau the Rostra.'' Here Cicero in-
geniously avoids the ostensive point. It was not its being in a conspicuous
place that gave offence; it was its being among the statues of the kings,
as indicating that Caesar was aiming at regal power. But Cicero pur-
posely loses sight of that, and denies that any body could be offended at
one statue being set up in so conspicuous a place as the Capitol, when
they were in no way displeased with two statues belng placed before the
Rostra, a place more conspicuous still. De plausu, as it respects applause,
he answers‚ Caesar never sought it; men were too much amazed with his
exploits, to think of it; and it was too common a thing, to be worthy of
Caesar.

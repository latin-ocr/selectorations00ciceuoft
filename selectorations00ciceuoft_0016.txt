During the distressing years of the civil war between J. Caesar and
Cn. Pompey which now followed, Cicero indeed sometimes appears uncer-
tain what to d0·, but his conduct is never equivocal. He remained faithful
to the cause of Pompey; and at first entertained the hope that the party
to which he belonged would come forth victorious from the struggle.
Before the commencement of the decisive contest, he endeavored to recon-
cile the two great antagonists with each other3 but at last, when every
hope of preserving peace had disappeared, he followed his friend Pompey
to Greece. It was in vain that many of his most distinguished and well-
meaning friends cautioned him against an aet of open hostility to Caesar; for
he remained firm and determined. He did not, however, take any part in
the battle of Pharsalus, B. c. 483 and as soon as he was informed of the
unfortunate issue of the contest, and of the flight of Pompey, he returned
to Ital v, and remained for a time at Brundusium. Caesar himself had re-
quested him, through Dolabella, to retum subsequently Cicero repented
of this step, and endeavored to excuse himself before his friends for this
separation from Pompey. Meanwhile Caesar continued his victorious
career, having sent Μ. Autouy to Italy to watch his interests at Rome.
Antony, who met Cicero at Brundusium, spared the partisan of Pompey,
though probably not of his own accord. From Brundusium Cicero betook
himself to his villa near Tusculum. Soon after he returned to Rome3 and
although he did not lose sight of the events which took place at the time,
he sought comfort and relaxation among his old and faithful friends—his
books.

Towards the end of J uly, B. c. 47, the victorious dictator, J. Caesar,
returned to Rome from his wars in Egypt and Asia, and showed himself
forgivmg and kind towards Cicero. Caesar's clemency is praised by Cicero
in the two orations for Ligarius and King Deiotarus, both of which belong
to this period, n. c. 46 and 45. Τὴε glowing admiration—nay‚ deification
of Oaesar—in these orations, is not the adulation of a calculating rhetori-
cian; for Cicero, as well as his contemporaries, knew Caesar’s greatness as
a general, his extraordinary aequirements, and intenectual superiority3 but
he delested his unmeasured love of domim'om he hated the tyrant. He
unreservedly expressed his joy at the murder of Caesar; nor did he after-
wards conoeal it before M. Antony, Caesar's successor3 and his Philippics
furnish an eloquent testimony of his unalterable aversion against the
enemies of the repuinC. Every enemy of M. Antony was welcome to
him, the hatred against whom made him an ardent admirer of Caesar
Octavianus, who, from the first, pursued the same course to which Caesar
had tanen a victim. But this same young man, whom he had looked upon
as the brightest hope, and as the saving anchor of the republic, concluded

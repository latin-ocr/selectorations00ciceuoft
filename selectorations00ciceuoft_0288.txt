more unworthy, that opposition should hitherto have been made. to Ga-
binius, shall I say,'' &cn : ne legaretur A. Gabinius, “that A. Gabini-
us should not be appointed licutenant.'' The AEtutian‚ as well as the
Licinian law soi-bade the proposer of a law concerniug any charge or

 

 

 

power, to assume that charge or power, or to del-ive any advantage from

the Gabini-an law. To this, however, successful opposition was made,
and very properly, not only on account of the principle involved, but

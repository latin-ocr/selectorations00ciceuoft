ORATION Fon Τ. ANNIUS nno. 287

This was a free town (municipium) of Latium, near the Appian way,
about 16 miles from Rome. lt was the birth-place of Milo, of which he
was now Dictator or Chief magistrate, and as such it was his duty,
yearly, on the day here mentioned, to nominate a priest to minister in
the temple of J uno Sospita built there: ipse, “he ” (Clodius):
ante sumn suadeam, “in front of his farm? 2. Ita-ut—relz'nqueret,
“In such a way that he lef1.” 3. Calceos ec vestimenta mutavit,
“ changed his shoes and his clothes,” i. e.‚ the dress worn in the senate, for
a travelling dress: z'd temporis, B. ‹§ 131, Obs. 1.—A„ ὣ S. f> 253, Rem.
3: redire potuisset, “could have 1-etu1-ned,‘’ lit„ “had been able to
return.'’ 4. Rhecla, “Carriage.” The Rheda was a four-wheeled
carriage drawn by mules: Graecis εουιίίὶὁαε, “ Greeian attendants.”
Learned men from Greeee were sometimes maintained in various capaei-
ties by wealthy Romans in their families; they also sometimes attended
them in their journeys, for their entertaimnent 5. Quum hic insi-
diator, applied to Milo, ironieally: poemclatus‚ ‘⁴ wrapped up in his
paenula.” This was a woollen eloai< or oovering worn by persons when
exposed in eold or stormy weather.——Observe here the conti-ast in
every particular between the equipments of Clodius and of Milo; how
thoroughly prepared the one was for an encounter, how utterly unpre-
pared the other, showing that he neither intended nor expected any
thing of the kind. 6. Hora fere undecima, “Not far from the
eleventh honi-,³¹ ἰ. e.‚ between 4 and 5 o’cloek in the afternoon.
⁶7. De loco superiore, “From higher ground,’'——-whieh gave the assailaut
great advantage: adversi, “those in fronte’ 8. Partim-—
partim, “some of them—others.” Though an adverb, this word is often
used in distributive sentences as a noun. Here it is distributive of illi,
the followers of Clodius; and below, of ii understood, as the antecedent
of qui and subject of occisi sunt, and fecerunt .· ejus servos, qui, “his
(Milo’s) servants, who:'' praesentz, “resolute'’ 9. Et re vera
putarent, “And doubtless thought so :'' fecerunt iol—quod, “did
that which,”—“acted as:'' non derivandi criminis causa, “ not for the
sake of shifting the blame,” scil„ from Milo to his servants—This whole
nai-ration is managed with consummate skill‚ to show the guilt of Clodius,
and the innocence of Milo in this eneounter.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

xl.—1. Nihil dico, qm'd res pubisca consecuta sit, “I say nothing as
to what the state has gained.” ln this sentence nihil is governed by dico
as a noun ; and the clause quid res publica, &e.‚ is to be regarded as a
substantive phrase, in the accusative, depending on quod ad ; or in the
ablative,›depending on de understood, and rendered “as to‚’' “concern-

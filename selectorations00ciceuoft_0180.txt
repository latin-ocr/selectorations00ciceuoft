“Has been without punishment or restraint:” quaestiones, “public
prosecutions:⁷' tu valuisti non solum ad, “thou hast succeeded not,
only in,’' lit., “thou hast had the power not only for.'' 10. Superiora
illa (scelera), “Those former crimes:” alluding to the many mmdcrs
(civium multorum coede) committed by Catiline in the times of Sulla Ι. 1.
ll. Nunc vero me (scil. patriam) totam esse, dne„ “But now that 1
should be wholly (every where, in every part) in fea1·.” The whole
of this sentence, down to abhorreat, is the subject of est ferendum:
quidquid increpuerit, “on every alarm‚'' lit. “whatever loud noise (crash)
may have been made :'’ quod α tuo scelere abhorreat, “which is not.
connected with thy crimes? si est verus (scil. timor) “if it is just?
i. e. “if there is good ground for it.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ne = ut non.

 

vnn—1. Nonne impetrare debeat? ‘⁴ Ought she not to obtain her re-
quest2'' The subjunctive debeat shows that the sentence is elliptical, and
contains a direct appeal to Catiline himself on the subject; = Nonne
(putas ut) debeat, de, “think you not that she ought‚” &e 2. Quid,
quod, see Vll. 4. te ipse, thyself, see II. 9: in custodiam,
“into private custody,’' sometimes called libera custodia. Persons sus-
pected of being dangerous to the state sometimes gave themselves up to

held the consulship with Volcatius Tullus, B. c. 66, four years before this.
3. Iisdem parietibus, “In the same house,” lit., ‘⁴ within the same

5. Virum optimum M. Allarcellum. This Marcellus was one of those who
knew of, and favored the conspiracy of Catiline, and of course a very
different person from the one mentioned below. This passage down to
putasti must, be taken ironically: videlicet, “no doubt? ironically:
ad mspz'candum, “to watch you :'' ad vindicandum, “to bring

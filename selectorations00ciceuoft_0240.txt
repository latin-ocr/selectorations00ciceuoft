to the other Pompeians. Yet he allowed Ligarius to live, though without
permitting him to retum to Italy. Ligarius, with many other Pompeians,
remained in exile inaAfrica, although his relations and friends exerted their
influence with Caesar, to allow him to return. N ow in order to render this
return forever impossible, Q. Tubero came forward with an accusation
against Ligarius, in which he charged him with vis—that is, with violent
and unlawful resistance to Caesar. Itis not improbable that Q. Tubero
was led to this step by the ill treatment he himself had experienced on
attempting to land in Africa, and Cicero, in fact, views the matter in this
light3 sor he tells him plainly that he was not concerned about the offence
committed against Caesar, but about the insult offered to himself (see
Chap. X). Cicero's defence is particularly successful by his skilsully
avoiding to mention the most important point of the accusation, namely,
the obstinate resistance of Q. Ligarius to Caesar, by describing Ligarihs's
residence in Africa as a simple and undoubted fact, indeed, but as an
absolute necessity; by putting the Tuberos on a level with Ligarius, and
as standing in need of the same generosity on the part of Caesar; and
lastly by appealiug again and again to the magnanimity and mercy of
Caesar, which had been shown to the orator himself, to the Tuberos, and
to many others. The whole oration breathes such a freshness, the
principa] fact of the accusation is avoided with such a happy irony,
and the opponents of his client are so successfully and completely beaten
by this same irony, and the bitter insinuations which are stealthily levelled
at them, that the speech for Ligarius is justly considered as one of the
most worthy of admiration. Caesar himself, however he may have felt
towards Ligarius, pardoned him and allowed him to return to Rome.
Ligarius repaid this generous act of Caesar with ingratitude, for soon after,
he joined the conspiracy against his benefactor. During the terrible soenes
of the triumvirate he died a violent death, like most of the conspirators.

Cicero delivered this speech in the Forum B. c. 46, in the alst year of
his age. His client was of course not present.

of Roman citizens for agriculture or commerce, made with the consent of
the state, and under its laws and protection. then the dwellings were
collected together and surrounded with a wall they were called urbes.
The municipia were towns, particularly in Italy, which possessed the
right of Roman citizenship, and in most cases the right of voting, but
were governed by their own laws. 4. Respomlebmzt‚ ‘⁴ Will give an

taken, and means provided by me:'' ut urbi satis esset praesidii,
“that there should be sufficient protection for the city,“ i, e.‚ for tho

a reply to this invective, but there is reason to believe that iu this he is

then, with fearful threats, quitted the senate, and, in the night following,
he, together with three hundred of his followers‚ betook themselves to

the Senate on the subject sor which they were called together, the orator,
filled with amazcment at seeing Catiline present himself in the senate,
appareme with a view to intimidate Cicero, or to face down the accusa-
tions against him by hypocritically assuming the appearance of an innocent
and injured man, breaks out iu this abrupt and eloquent invective address-
ed to Catilinc himself, to whom of course every eye was now directed with
indignation. The question licre put refers to the long period during which
he had been engaged in plots against his country, and the means by which
he had so often eludcd the punishment due to his crimes. See Introduc-

other times of danger, a guard of soldiers was placed on the Palatine hill
for the protection of the city, and of the Senate assembled in the temple
os Jupiter Stator, at the foot of the hill. and which for this reason is called
below munitissimus locus. The emperors afterwards having taken up
their resi-‘leuce here, the term Palatium came to signify the residence of
the emperor. Hence our word palace. 7. Urbis νίῃῑῖἱα», “ Sentinels‚⁷’

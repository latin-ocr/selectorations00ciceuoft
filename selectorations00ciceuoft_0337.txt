Vnt-THE PRINCIPLES OF GREEK GRAMMAR.

This work is intended to be a comprehensive manual of Greek Gram-
mar, adapted to the nse of the younger, as well as of the more advanced
uidente, in schools and collegcs. Both iu Etymology and SyntaX, the
leading principles ol' Greek Grammar are exliibitcd in definitione and
rules, as few and as brief as possible, in order to be easily committed to
'neinory, and so comprehensive as to be of general and easy applicat. on
This work is now more extensively used than any other of the kind in
the. country.

LK—GREEK READER.

This work, like the Latin Readen is properly a seqnel to the Greek
Grammar, and an introduction to the stndy of the Greek classic authors.
It seeks to aceomplish its object in the same way as the Latin Reader
(See above, 30. vl.) With these are connected

SPENCEi-t’s LATIN LESSONS, with exercises in par-sing, introduc-
μιν] to Bullions' Latin Grammar.

In this series of books, the three Grammars, English, Latin, and
Greek, are all on the same plan. The general arrangement, definitione,
rules, eto„ are the same, and expressed in the same language, as nearly as
the nature of the case would admit. To those who study Latin and
Greek, much time and labor, it is believed, will be saved by this method,
ooth to teuchcr and pupil ; the analogy and peculiarities of the different
languages being kept in view, will show what is common to all, or pecu·
liar to each; the confusion and difficulty unnecessarily occasioned by tho
nse of elementary works‚ differ-ing widely from each other in language
md structure, will be avoided; and the progress of the student rendered
rnnch more rupid, easy, and satisfactory.

No series of Grammars having this ol ›ject in view, has hel-etosore been
prepared, und the advnntages which they offer cannot be obtained in nn
equa] ‹logi-ce by the study of any other (lrummars now in use. They
form acomplcte course os elementary books, in which the substance ol
the latest and best G raminars in each lnnguagc has been compresscd into
n volume os convenient size, bcaiitil'ully printed on superior pnper, ncntly
aud strongly bound, and are put nt the lowest prices at which they can
be nffurded.

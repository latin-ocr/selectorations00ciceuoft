17 4 NOTEs ON THE

“Do you look for new tablets?'' i. e., new registers of debts.. To persons
deeply involved in debt, which they were unable to pay, sometimes by a
senatus consultum, or by a vei-dict of the praetor‚ new registers were
granted by which their debts were reduced, or even completely can-
celled. This Catiline promised his followers. Sall. Cat. 21. 9. Meo
beneficio, &e., “By my kindness new registers will be brought fon-ward,
but they will be-(tabulae auctionariae)—registers of property to be sold
at auction.'’ Here there is a play on the words novae tabulae. Cicero
would indeed bring about a cancelling of their debts; but it would be iu
the honorable way of selling the property of debtors at auetion„ and
applying the proceeds to pay off their debts: for, said he, neque isti qui,
&e., “those who have possessious can be safe (preserved from rain) in no

 

other way.'’

 

10. Quod, “This:’' neque certare, &e., “and not
to struggle with payments of interest from the income of their estates?
-The revenue of their estates being nearly, if not wholly necessary to
pay the interest on their debts, these must every day be increasing, and
their means of paying them becoming less—a process which must end in
ruin: uteremur, &e., “we would now have these both wealthicr
and better citizens.'’

“It may be necessary for them to submit (yield the precedence) to some
fugitive or gladiator” (like Catiline)‚ concedi, lit. “that it should be
yielded by them.” 6. AEtate jam affectum, “Already advanced in
years,'' lit. “affected with age.” 7. Ea: iis coloniis quas Sulla, dte.
The dictator Sulla had rewarded his soldiers by establishing whole
legions in Italian towns, such as Faesulae‚ Capua, and others, whose
citizens were obliged to give up their property to the soldiers. These
were the military colonies of Sulla, of which there were twenty-three.
The soldiers, who thus became suddenly rich, usually squandered their
property in a very short time, and hence were anxious for another civil
war in which to enrich themselves anew.

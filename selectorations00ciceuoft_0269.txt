ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW.

INTRODUCTION.

Tm: speech pro leye M'anilia, or, as it is called in the manuscripts, De
imperio Cn. Pompeii, was delivered by Cicero in the consulship of M.
AEmilius Lepidus, and L. Volcatius Tullus, Β. c. 66. He was then praetor,

in the East for a period of seven years, and had now been recalled. The
Pontio king had again advanced from the mountains of Armenia into
Asia Minor, and Acilius Glabrio, who was consul, Β. c. 67, and succeeded
Lucullus, was unable to offer him any effeetual resistance. At the
time when Mithridates was gradually reeovering his strength, Pompey
had been engaged in a short, but successful and brilliant war against the
pirates: he had subdued and pursued them to the remotest eorners in
the east of the Mediterranean. When Cicero delivered the present
speech, Pompey’s campaign against the pirates was at an cnd3 but he still
possessed unlimited command of the ficet and army in all parts of the
Mediterranean, and on all its coasts to a considerable distance from the
sea. We are not intimately acquaintcd with the secret motives which

,aetuated the· leading men at Rome, but it is very possible that Pompey

Deiotarus is a rash, hot-headed man, he would· never think of these things,
and, of course, not be restrained by them.” How preposterons such an
objection is, Cicero intimatos by the ironic credo ——goes ou to refute it,
and to strengthen his argument by defending the character of Deiotarus.

who wisely covers and protects himself with his shield from the stroke of
his adversary. 3. Quamquam Ιιοε Ioco, dxc„ ‘⁴ And yet, in this point, I
think that the defence of Deiotarus should rest, not so much on his talents
and prudence, as on the honor and sauctity of his life.” 4. Cui porro?

posed todens or bellua, and means α lamnam being]; vir is opposed to
mulier, and means a man, as possessed of those qualities by which a man
is distinguished from a woman. The former is applied to man in his social
relations as a member os the human family; the latter to man in his civil
relations as a member of the state. This distinction, however, is not al-
ways observed when the words are used separately‚ aud not together as
here. (i. At (Icoc finyz'tz's) quam non modo, dic„ “ But this you pre-

As if to say: How absurd to suppose that Deiotarus should employ armed
men to slay Caesar in such a way that it could not fail to be publiely
known, when he could have got this trusty physician to destroy him se-
cretly by poison in his food or drink 1 —— 9. [ςέο adolescente, scil. Castum

wheuhe first heard of this matter, he immediately suspected it would be
attempted to prove by this physician, that Deiotarus proposed to him 10

sufficient to discredit the whole affatim for in the other case these armed
men, and not this slave, would have been the proper wstnesses and had

the evening was the time for the principal meal and for company. When
in the circle of his friends, he was always cheerful, and particularly witty:
his sarcasms were celebrated throughout Rome; and Caesar himself is said
to have requested that they should be collected and recorded. After
Cicero's death, his freedman, M. Tullius Tiro, made a complete collection
of his witty and humorous sayings in three books, which are unfortunately
lost.

The splendor and variety of his life was heightened by the number of
his magnificent villas in which⁷ notwithstanding the contempt of works of
art which he feigns in the speeches against Verres, he testified in the
noblest manner his taste and love of the beauties of nature. Most of them
were situated on the most exquisite spots, near the beautiful coasts of
Campania and Latium3 and they were adorned with the finest sculptures
of Greek wmkmanship, and with the most elegant and tasteful furniture.
The large sums which Cicero spent upon the erection and embellishment
of these villas, were acquin-ed especially by the numerous and rich legacies
which were left to him by friends and clients during the period of his
public caree1·; for it was customary at Rome for grateful clients to leave
to their patrous a portion of their property, as a token of their gmtituder,
and to receive such legacies was thought highly honorable. His delight in
building‚ however, as we know from his letters, sometimes led him beyond
his means, which obliged him afterwards to economize.

Cicero's love of splendor, though in all the relations of life he was
dignified, moderate, and of a strictly moral purity. is nearly akm to his
manifest desire to win applause, recognition, and fame. His e.1emies
ridiculed his vanity; but many did not understand that it would hm e been
something superhuman not to feel exalted by the consciousness οι Lis own
worth, considering his extraordinary talents, and what he had accom-
plished. Cicero did not indeed detract from his own merits, nor did he
conceal thcm; but he never exaggerated them.

The family relations of our author were at first happy. In nis letters
he speaks with great affection of his wife Terentia and his daughter Tullia3
but in B. c. 45, his daughter Tullia died, and he divorced his wife. His son

Marcus, who survived him for many years, was not worthy οι his great
father. ⁵

We cannot conclude this brief outline without mentioning M. Tullius
Tiro, the freedman and friend of Cicero, who arranged the literary remains
of his illustrious friend with skill and learning. A large number of
Cicero's works has come down to our time; but we have yet to lament the
irreparable loss of several orations and theoretical works ; for none of tho²
productione of a mind like Cicero’s can be looked upon with indifference.

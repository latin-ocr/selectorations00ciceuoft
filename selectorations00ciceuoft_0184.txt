Tulli. The supposed complaint (quoerz'mom'a) of his country, of all Italy,
and of the whole republic, addressed to Cicero, is contained in the re-
maining part of this section. In this, the orator ingeniously makes his
country assei-t, as the ground of her complaint, and confirm by the same
facts, the very things which he had already asserted and confirmed re-
specting the power of the consuls to resort to the severest and most
speedy measures in cases such as ‘that of Catiline. 5. Tune—exire
patiere, “Will you suffer to depart, him‚'’ &a 6. Evocatorem ser-
vorum, “Who calls to arms the slaves,'’ lit. “the caller—forth of the
slaves.'’ It appears fron] Sallust, that though a proposal had been made
to employ the assistance os the slaves, and Lentulus had urged it on
Catiline (Sall. Cat. 44), there is not only no mention of his concurring iu
this proposal, but Sallust mentions expressly that he refused it. Cat. 56,

go out, he would be in a condition to return to it with more power of
mischief. 8. sslactari, &e.‚ “To be visited with the sererest punish-
ment,’⁷ lit. “To bc sacrificed:” viz. as an atonement to his outraged coun-
try. 9. illosne majorum (impedit) .? “ Docs the custom of our :111cestors:⁷'

signify to pass or cnact a law. The laws here referred to were probably
a lez Valeria, passed Β. e. 509, respecting an appeal to the people against
the magistrate, and punishing with death and confiscation of property
any one who should attempt to usurp the government.—Liv. Π. S—the
leges Porciae, which ordained that no one should bind, scourge, or put to
death a Roman citizen, and the lex Sempronia, passed Β. 0. 123, that no
Roman citizen should be sentenced to death without a resolution of the
people, &a ¹

return to the people.'' This is spoken ironically hominemv per te coqui-
tum, “a man known through yom· own merits.” Cicero was a novus
homo,· i. e.‚ he had no ancestors who had been invested with high offices
at Rome. 13. Tam mature, “So early.’' Cicero was elected consul,
suo anno, i. e.‚ as soon as he was eligible on account of his age, which was
after completing his 43d year, and having previously passed through
(omnes honorum yradus) all the gradations of honors, viz. the offices of
quaestor, aedile, and praetor. 14. &veritatis ac fortitudinis invidia,

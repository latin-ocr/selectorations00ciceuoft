ORATION FOR T. AN ΝΠ] S MILO.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms beautiful oration was made in the 55th year of Cicero’s age, upon
the following occasion. In the year of Rome, 701, aud s. c. 52, T. Annius
Milo, Q. Metellus Scipio, and P. Plautius HypsaeuS, were candidates for the
consulship; and, according to Plutarch, pushed on their several interests
with such open violence and bribery‚ as if it had been to be carried only
by money or arms. P. Clodius Milo’s professed enemy, stood at the same
time for the praetorship, and used all his interest to disappoint Milo, by
whom, if elected consul, he was sure to be controlled in the exercise of
his magistracy. The senate, and the better sort, were generally in favor
of Milo; and Cicero, in particular, served him with the greatest zeal.
Three of the tribunes were violent against him ; the other seven were his
fast friends, especially M. Coelius, who, out, of regard to Cicero, was very
active in his services But whilst matters were proceeding in a very favor-
able train for him, and nothing seemed wanting to crown his success but
to bring on the election, which his adversaries for that reason endeavored
to keep back, all his hopes and fortunes were blasted at once by an un-
happy rencounter with Clodius. On the 20th of Janual‘y,B. c. 51, Milo
set out on a journey to Lanuvium. Near Bovfflae, he met Clodius, who
was returning to Rome, after visiting some of his property. Both were
accompanied by armed followers, but Milo’s party was the sti-onger. The
two antagonists had passed each other without disturbance, but two of
the gladiators in the rear of Milo's troop, picked a quarrel with some of
the sollowers of Clodius, who immediately turned round, and rode up to
the scene of disputo, when he was wounded in the shoulder by one of the
gladiators. The fray now became general, and the party of Clodius being
put to flight, betook themselves with their leader to a house near Boviuae.

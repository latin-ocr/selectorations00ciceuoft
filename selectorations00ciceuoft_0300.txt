The roads in Italy, and especially near Rome, were infested by robbers,
so that for safcty, persons travelling required a guard, and to be armed:
uon liceret, “ it would not be lawful.” 6. Est ἱρέων lzoec. The,

illud refers to the following clause, caedem———sactam esse, “that the senate
decidcd that the slaughter, (ke, was an offenee against the statc.'' Cicero
replies, in substance, that the judgment of the senate spoken of referred
to the act, but did not decide where the yuilt lay, whether with Clodius
or with Milo—and that in all the discussions relating to this subject, for

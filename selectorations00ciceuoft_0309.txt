vestrae aures, (he, “are your ears not at home, 1101· familiar with
the common report of the city 3⁵¹ namely: quas (eyes, “what laws:‘’
fuerit impositurus, (he, “he was about to impose, and fix indeEbly

 

 

(lit, brand) upon every one of us.” The scheme here referred to, was to
get a law passed by which freedmen (libertini), who had now the right
of voting only in the city tribes, might have it also in the rustic tribes.
The whole Roman territory was then divided into 35 tribes, of which 4
were in the city, and 31 without the city. It is easy to see that such a
law would have added muo⁸h to the number of votem, end seeured for a
time immense power to the framers of such a law. This was of course a
favorite measure with party leaders in the minority, by which they hoped
to raise themselves into power. The eleetion by tribes (comitia tributa)
was in fact the only election by the people3 for in this, all votes were
equal, whereas, in the comitia centuriata, or election by centul-ies, while
the people were not exeluded, the scheme was sueh as to render their
vote nearly worthless. By the latter mode, consuls and praetors were
ehosen; by the former, the inferior magistrates. See Adam's Roman An-
tiquities. 8. Tamquam Palladium, “As if a Palladium”—a wooden
image of Pallas, (or Mine1·va‚) brought from Troy to Rome and laid up in
the temple of Vesta. When 1his temple was burned, the Palladium was
tesoued by the high-priest Metellus, and was regarded as the symbol of
safety to the empire. 9. Ut praeclarum, ae„ arrange: ut posses cle-
fe‘rre praeclarum ¹munus videlicet, et instrumentum tribunatus ad aliquem,
&ez instrumentum, “an instrument,’' or “ code of instructions.”
Of the sentence following thia, in Orelli’s text, all but two words (atque
per) is lost; and as these words by themselves give no meaning they are
here omitted. The three following sentences also are wanting in the
common editions lo. De nostrum omnium. Here we have an ex-
ample of the figure aposioposis, or intentional breaking off, without fin-
ishing, a. sentence begun, which is sometimes used with great effect.
Having begun the sentence, the orator here stops as if afraid to go on,
being terrified by the threatening looks of S. Clodius, and adds non audeo
totum dicere. 11. Ec adspexit me, dte„ ‘⁴ And he looked at me with such
loolzs as he was aecustomed to assume, when he threatened universal de-
struction to every one.'' 12. Lumen curioe. This is a sort of ambiguous
jest, to eall S. Clodius, “ the light of the sonate? as if he meant to compli-
ment· him as a great man, while in fact he sareastically refers to his

burning the senate-house, when he erected in it a funeral pile for the
body of Clodius.

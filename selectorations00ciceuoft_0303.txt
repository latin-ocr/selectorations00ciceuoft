ORATION FOR Τ. ANNIUS MILO. 283

was not necessary, sor) it is evident.'' ——— 10. Nos fateri, “That we
(identifying himself with his client) aeknowledge (the sact).''
11. Tam hauc salutarem, dxc„ ‘⁴ As well this aequitffing, as that condemu-
mg lette1·.” WVhen judges were to vote on a eriminal trial, the letters
A and C were put into their hands, by depositing one or other of which
in the urn, their sentence was given: A sor Absolvo‚ “I acquit‚'' hence
called litera salutaris, and 0 for condemno, “I eondemxss‘ hence called
litera trinis. Another ballot, inscribed N. L„ non liquet, “It is not
clear,'' was sometimes given, and when these were in the majority, it left
the ease undecided. 12. Quid vos in judicando spectare oporteret.
‘⁴ What you ought to keep in view in making up your ve1·dict.’' Thus
does he show, in oppositiou to the assumption of those opposed to Milo,
that Pompey had not deeided against Milo, but had left the question for
the judges now to decide. Finally, he makes the appeal on this point to

 

 

Pompey himself. 13. Quod sua sponte fecit, &Q “Whether what
he did of his own accord, he thought should be attributed to his regard

for P. Clodius, or to the times‚” i. e, to the excited state of the people at
that time„

 

VlI·—l. Tribunus plebis JI. Dr'usus. To show that this measure was
now resorted to only on account of the peculiar state of the times, and
not from any favor for Clodius, he goes on to mention a number of cases
of violence, respecting which no investigation had been instituted: these,
too, are of such a character as to bring odium on Clodius and his party,
and to excite the indignation of Pompcy and those who sought his favor.
This is done with great tact to operate silently in favor of Milo.—
Μ. Livius Drusus, a man distinguished for his wealth, talents, and weight
os character, was assassinated at his own house, when he was attempting
to get a law passed to confer the freedom of the city on some of the
principa] towns of Italy: avunculus hujus judicis, “the uncle· of
this our judgeff’ M. Cato was one of the judges on this trial of Milo.
2. Nihil populus consultus (est), “The people were never consulted.'’
Nihil is a stronger negative than non. See I. Or. in Cat. I„ 5.
3. Quantum luctum, dxc„ “How great mourning have we heard,’' dte.
Luctus means “grief,” expressed by loud lamentations3 moeror, “grief,'’
expressed by sadness of countenance; dolor, “grief '’ in the hcart, without
rcgard to its expression—P. Africanus was found dead in his bed, and
by many, nnd especially by Cicero, was supposed to have been strangled.
C. Papirius Carbo was suspected, but there was no investigation.
4. Quia non alio facinore, dte„ ‘·' Because the crime is the same whether
the persons slain are illustrious or obscure :”—Render this sentence

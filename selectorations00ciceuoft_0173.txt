‘⁸ Did the satisfaction due to the republic delay‚ for a single day thei-caster,
the death of L. Saturninus Γ (ize. Some others again govern the genitive
by mors ac poena together in the nominative, as the subject of remorata est
used intransitively. Ernesti and most other editors have Satcc7·ninum,'
dxc„ as in the text, governed by remorata esc used transitively. This
reading is usually rendered, ‘⁴ Did death and the satisfaction due to the
tate, for a single day, fail to overtake L. Saturninus,⁷’ dxc. ‘⁶ Fail to over-
take” is indeed a free and unusual rendering of remorata ese, but it very
evidently expresses the meaning of the whole. ‘⁴ Retain'' (which is the
strict meaning of the word), viz„ in life, i. e., “ suffer to live,’' conveys the
same idea. But if we should suppose an ellipsis of perdere, excipere, or
the like, after remorata est used intransitively, all difficulty would dis-
appear; and as this accords fully with the meaning of the sentence,
it would seem to be a less violent solution of the difficulty, than, from
mere conjecture, to change the whole structure of the sentence. Muretus
thinks that mors (ac) is an interpolation made by some one to explain
the meaning of rei public-ce poena. 6. Vicesimum diem, dic. (the ace.
of time, B.§ 131. R. xli. A. a: S. ᾧ 236), is here contrasted with wzum
diem, to show the lenity exercised towards Catiline. According to this,
if taken strictly, the decree referred to must have been passed on the
‘loth Oct. preceding; but, as it was not passed till the 21st, Cicero must
be regarded as speaking in round numbers. See 111.‚4. ⁷. Confes-
tim interfectum te esse convenit, “It was fit that you should have been
put to death immediately‚” viz„ on the passing of the decree, as was done
in the cases referred to Convenit is in the perfect tense. -—-—- 8. Patres
conscripti, “ Conscript fathers”—a title by which the Roman senators
were addressed. At first they were called patres. The original number,

 

 

as chosen by Romulus, was one hundred. It was some time afterwards
doubled by Tarquinius Priscus, those added being called patres minorum
qentium. This number having been greatly diminished by the cruelties
of Tarquinius Superbus, was, aster the expulsion of the kings, increased
by Brutus, the first consul, to three hundred, from the leading men οι
equestrian rank. Those now enrolled were, by way of distinction, called
patres conscripti—a title afterwards given to all the senators assembled.
The mode of address at first probably was patres et conscripti, which, by
omitting the et, carne to be patres conscripti:

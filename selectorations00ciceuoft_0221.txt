ORATION Fon THE rom AizcmAs. ‘201

ἀει, “Had he not a dwelling at Rome,3'' ⁷ 14. An ‘non est professus?
“Did he not make his claimi” In this way Cicero anticipatos two objec-
tions and refutes them. 15. Immo vero, dxc„ “Nay, indeed, he did
so in those registers which alone,” dxc. Namely, those of the praetor
Metellus mentioned below.

 

 

v.--1. Nam, “Fon'’ introducing the reason why the registers ο.
Metellus, in which the name of Archias wus enrolled, are more worthy of
credit than those of Appius, who was careless‚ or those of Gabinius, who
was corrupt: damnationem, Gabinius was found guilty of extortion
in his province of Achaia.

 

 

‘20 Resiqnasset, “Had destroyed ;” the allu-
sion is to unsealing and corrupting a document. 3. Judices, see above

credo, “I am to believe, Ι suppose, that the Rhegini;”—cred0 is used
ironically. These were nations in Magna Graecia in the south of Italy.
6. scenicis artificibus laryiri, “To bestow freely on stage-players,’'
a class of men held in little repnte by the Romans. ⁷. Quid?
“ What1” an exclamation expressing astonishment that any one should
deny the citizenship of Archiae, when so many of inferior inei-lt obtained
this privilege and enjoyed it unmolested. S. Post civitatem datam,
“After the right of citizenship was given,” viz., under the Plautian law
mentioned above: post leyem Papiam. This law, carried by the
tribune C. Papius, Β. c. 65, being 24 years after the Plautian, ordained
that all foreigners should be expelled from the city. In consequence of
this. many foreigners contrived to have their names surreptitiously
Inserted in the registers of the free towns, and so evaded the law. These
registers, being thus corrupted, were of course worthless as evidence
either for or against a claim of citizenship. 9. Consus nostros requi-
ris, “You ask us for our census lists.'' When a census was taken at
Rome, which was usually done every five years, the names of the citizens
were enrolled in the censor's list. The name of Archias was not on these
lists; and this fact the accuser, it seems, brings forward as evidence
against the claim of citizenship made by Archias. Cicero in defencc
admits the fact but shows it could not be otherwise; because either,
when the census was taken, Archias was absent from Rome with Lucullus
on military duty, or, when he was in Rome, there was no enrolrncnt of
names. 10. Scilicet, “Of course:'' est enim obscurum, “furit
is not known, I suppose.” The expression is ironicaL and mouns “every
body knows.'’ -·— ll· Proximis censoribus, “Under the last censors‚”

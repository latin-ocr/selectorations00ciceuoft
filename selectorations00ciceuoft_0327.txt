xxia—1. Est, est profecto illa vis, “There is, there is indeed such a
power:” et non inest, Am, “and there is not (i. e., “without its
being'’), in this‚” dte. ΤἈΘ argument is from the less to the greater:
thus, If there is such an active and thinking principle in our bodies,‘&c.,
much more does it exist in this so great and glorious system of nature.
2- Nisi sorte idcirco ηοη putant, “ Unlcss perhaps any think it does
not exist sor this 1·eason:‘’ quia, ὣο. 3. Ea vis igitur ipsa.
“That then is the very power, which, &e.:’' cui primum mentem
injecit, “first inspired him (Clodius) with the purpose? ut ......
audiret, &a 4. Ne mediocri quidem ...... cura, “Nor even by any
ordinary care.'’ 5. Reliyiones ἔρδω, “Our sacred places theniselves.'’
Reliyio, taken objectively, means any object of veneration, such as
temples, altars, ceremonies, or even the gods themselves. The next
sentenoe shows that the reference here is to places and objects regarded
with veneration: commovisse se, “to have bestirred themselves,''
i. e., “to have been interested.'' There is here a sort of personifieation,
investing the objeets referred to with life and intelligenee: et jus
in illo suum retinuisse, “and to have vindieated their rights in (punish-
ing) him.‘' 6. Albam· tumult atque luci (the reliyimzes of the preced-
ing sentence), “Ye Alban mounte and groves.’' Alba Longa, one of the
most ancient eities of Latium, was situated about twenty miles from
Rome. Here Clodius had a villa or summer resfflence, in erecting or
improving which, he had eut down the grows leveled the mounds and
altars, consecrated to the worship of their gods, who are here represented
by Cicero as taking vengeance on Clodius for his profane violation of
sacred places. 7. Sacrorum populi Romani, dxc„ “The companions
and partners of the rites of the Roman people.’' The forins of Roman
worship were first derived from Alba (Livy, L, 7), and when that city
was utterly destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, and the people removed to
Rome, they continued to observe their own rites and modes of worship.
Hence the Alban altars are here called sociae et oequales: Substruc-
tionum insanis molibus oppresserat, “had buried with the mad piles of
his buildings.” Ch. XX„ ᾧ 53. 8. Vestrae tam, arce, vestrae reliffloncx,
“Your eeremonies, Ο altars, your rites then flom-ishew' (namely, when
Clodius sell): Latiaris sancte Jupiter, “O venei-able Jupiter Latiaris.’'
In order to keep the Latin association firm to their engagement to him,
Tarquinius Superbus ereeted a new temple in the midst of them to
Jupiter Latiaris, on a hill near the ruins of Alba, where the united
cantone met annually on the 27th April, jointly offered sacrifices to
J upiter as the guardian of the Latin lcague, and seasted together in token
os their union. This festival was called ferite Latinoe:

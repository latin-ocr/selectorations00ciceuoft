a que. 2. In illam aetatem, “To that age :” i. e., “to a man of that
age.⁷' Deiotarus was then an old man, the grandfather of a man old
enough to have served iu war under both Cicero and Pompey, and after
that to stand up as an accuser, hence exacta catate below. 3. Quibus
ille studiis, dac„ “From early youth he had aceustomed himself to the
pursuits not of daneing:'’ sed ut uteretur (a change of construction
for utendi), ‘⁴ but of using.'’ Both saltandi and ut uteretur are dependent
on studiis. 4. Quod haerere, dxc. This clause depeuds on admirari.
5. Hic vero adolescens, “But this young man‚⁷’ scil. Castor. Adole-
scens is used in contrast with the great age of Deiotarus, to show the in—
aolence and irreverence of his bringing such a charge against-his aged
grandfather: ·——- meus miles, “a soldier under my command :'' com-
milito, “ my fellow-soldier.'' Both were under the command of Pompey
in Greece. Cicero, of course, had had the opportunity of knowing him

rus: quos concursus, rizo„ “ what crowds he was wont to collect :''
illa causa, scil. the cause of Pompey. 6. Eaeercim amisso, “When
the army (of Pompey) was lost.” It is said that of Pompey's army there

ad meam auctoritatem, “to my opinion.” '70 Quod et ipse, Aac„
‘⁴ But even he himself continued to burn with eager desire sor this very
war.” The orator is earet'ul to set forth the zeal of both Castor and his
father in the cause of Pompey, and of course against Caesar, to show the
maliciousness of the accuser in charging Deiotarus with hostility to Oaesar
—a crime of which he himself had been equally guilty. 8. Felix
ista domus, “Fortunate your family.’' Observe the force of ista:
quoeadepta sit, “in having obtained :’' qui accusetur, “in being ac-
cused.” Β. ὁ 141, Rule iii.—A. (iz S. ᾧ 264. 8 : non modo apud te, dvc,
